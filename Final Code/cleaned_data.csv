6,uo-O3xXjKWGXB93k7RwBgg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"i always get a little wary when i see a 2-2.5 star rating for a business.

one stars are usually self-explanatory. it's a terrible establishment. but a 2-2.5 star rating with a varied mix of 1-star and 4- and 5-star reviews hints at more going on. like maybe a business going through a bad period that had previously been good. or vice versa. either way, there's more to the story than just simply being a poor business.

it was with this reasoning that i went to aragosta for restaurant week. i had read the reviews beforehand and prepared myself for the worst. it never came.

the food was exceptionally good, much better than i would have expected. the calamari appetizer was fresh and delicious. it was not fried, which is a welcome change, and the calamari pieces were tender and chewy all at once, served with an olive paste and tomato sauce under a bed of bitter greens. the flavors and textures complemented each other perfectly. the dish felt refreshing and satisfying without being the least bit slimy or rich.

my friend got the fish next and i decided on the chicken. i normally never get chicken as an entree but it came with an exotic mushroom polenta and i figured i had to try that. i also felt the other options were too boring (mostly pastas). the chicken was quite good, if a little dry in parts and the polenta definitely satisfied. there was so much food, i ended up having to take half home.

the olive oil cake was a real winner. i've had olive oil cake before and loved it but my friend had never had it so i was excited for her to try it. just like me, she loved it. the cake was soft, moist and flavorful, perfectly complemented by the light strawberry-flavored ice-cream it was served with. delicious.

for drinks, i had the whiskey cobbler. i normally don't like whiskey as a mixer but they used crown royal and fresh fruit juice and the combination was fantastic. their drinks are pricey, often around $15 a pop for not very unusual creations, so this might not be the place to go for lots of cocktails.

now, i've noticed a lot of the 1-star reviews for aragosta have to do with poor service. obviously, someone in management was paying attention because the service we experienced was excellent. 

there was one bad moment in the beginning of our meal when our waiter decided to explain the menu line by line. as in comment on each dish in the menu, one after another. there were a lot of dishes. i am not a patient person and i hate it when people do things like hand you a piece of paper and make you read it aloud with them, which is what this was like. so i politely cut him off as quickly as i could and told him we'd just be doing the restaurant week menu (which we'd already told him). other than that, though, he was attentive and friendly. the hostess was also very nice and everyone seemed like they genuinely wanted you to be there, which is always a great feeling.

the decor contains the best parts of the previous restaurant sensing, which i had the pleasure of also experiencing. the curtains are still there along with the wide windows, giving the place a breezy, al fresco feel. different parts of the restaurant have different lighting and we were seated in a particularly dim part, between two curtains. very moody and romantic but i must say it was almost a little too dim to read the menu and the curtain next to us did little to protect us from the obnoxiously loud party of 6 drunken women beside us. if you're here on a date night, ask to be seated in a corner, not by a curtain.",alway get littl wari see 225 star rate busi one star usual selfexplanatori terribl establish 225 star rate vari mix 1star 4 5star review hint go like mayb busi go bad period previous good vice versa either way there stori simpli poor busi reason went aragosta restaur week read review beforehand prepar worst never came food except good much better would expect calamari appet fresh delici fri welcom chang calamari piec tender chewi serv oliv past tomato sauc bed bitter green flavor textur complement perfectli dish felt refresh satisfi without least bit slimi rich friend got fish next decid chicken normal never get chicken entre came exot mushroom polenta figur tri also felt option bore mostli pasta chicken quit good littl dri part polenta definit satisfi much food end take half home oliv oil cake real winner ive oliv oil cake love friend never excit tri like love cake soft moist flavor perfectli complement light strawberryflavor icecream serv delici drink whiskey cobbler normal dont like whiskey mixer use crown royal fresh fruit juic combin fantast drink pricey often around 15 pop unusu creation might place go lot cocktail ive notic lot 1star review aragosta poor servic obvious someon manag pay attent servic experienc excel one bad moment begin meal waiter decid explain menu line line comment dish menu one anoth lot dish patient person hate peopl thing like hand piec paper make read aloud like polit cut quickli could told wed restaur week menu wed alreadi told though attent friendli hostess also nice everyon seem like genuin want alway great feel decor contain best part previou restaur sens pleasur also experienc curtain still along wide window give place breezi al fresco feel differ part restaur differ light seat particularli dim part two curtain moodi romant must say almost littl dim read menu curtain next us littl protect us obnoxi loud parti 6 drunken women besid us your date night ask seat corner curtain

after going up to the bar twice to request water and menus for our table, we were told by our server that they did not have oysters even though the website claims ""every friday is ostrica friday this spring!"" we asked what was being offered in place of the oyster special and the server proceeded to get angry, raise his voice and then blame it on the chef. the server finally asked the manager to come over to our table.
 
we asked the manager the same question and instead of acknowledging that there was an issue, he seemed completely distracted and unapologetic for the confusion. we were then served two rounds of six mediocre oysters. the manager never returned to see how his patrons were faring after the miscommunication. the manager never offered to make amends or account for the poor service.

this initial attitude spoiled the rest of the dinner. the food was ok (we had the gnocchi / lamb and seared tuna) but certainly wasn't any better than another restaurant on the waterfront where we could have perhaps had an actual waterfront view.

while there, we ordered dinner - steak entree, burrata salad, tuna tataki - all were good, but considerably expensive. the food wasn't bad. it was decent...but we don't go back to restaurants for ""decent"" food, especially when the cheapest entree is $24.

the really annoying part was that our fire pit table kept going out every couple minutes. at first, the waiters would re-light it for us if they came by, but we got tired of waiting (and getting cold) every time so we figured the controls out and ended up having to re light it about 30+ times ourselves throughout our meal (not exaggerating). 

all said, it was a $120 bill when you include the gilt certificate...and i didn't even order a full entree. just felt steep for the experience we had to be honest. again, not bad, but not great especially considering the price. with no ""special"" items in the s'mores platter made in-house (it was just pre-made items that they took out of packaging) and a fire pit that didn't work, it didn't really make for an experience i would repeat.

i went to dinner at al bacio as part of a group the other night for yelp restaurant week (yay 30% off!). we arrived at the venue, which is located in a business complex, around 6:30. while we had a reservation for 12, we had no problem getting in and having a nice table set up for us.

we took our seats and the friendly waiter brought us menus and the drink list. the food and drink here is really well-priced (i think the most expensive dish was $24). more specifically, al bacio sells all of it's wine either by the bottle or for just $6 a glass, so i ordered a pinot grigio to start. it was a solid wine, but the small amount made me wish i had ordered a bottle (which i think was something like $20).

after looking through the menu and trying a complimentary bread starter that was crunchy and tasty, i put in an order for the snapper with a salad as my side. while all our food didn't quite come out at the same time, the timing was ok. the salad was good and the snapper was fairly solid. it came with a nice sauce on top that i liked, but a few others commented was a bit salty.

39,xlXN7SNHkNLVDHrJ9ueUcw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"pasta vino is a relatively expensive restaurant. so, it's reasonable to expect a higher standard here than at, say, a fast food place.

positives:
1. despite the fact that the individual with our party responsible for making reservations had not done so, they squeezed in our party of six fairly quickly.

negatives:
1. if you, a relative, or a friend, must use a wheelchair, skip pasta vino. this is one of those restaurants with a twee demi-wall near the door - the sort that is nearly, if not actually, impossible to get a wheelchair around. the tables are packed in so tight that i could barely walk between them to reach the restroom. the dining area and the hall with the restrooms is separated by a decorative bead curtain that is, apparently, metal. i can't imagine how anyone in a wheelchair could possibly use the restroom.

2. most meals are a stand alone entree with no vegetable or salad on the side. complimentary bread is served, but who wants to fill up on carb-packed bread while waiting for a meal of carb-packed pasta? no one, that's who. meanwhile, fricking cici's has a salad bar at no extra charge with their ""pizza"" buffet. for heaven's sake pasta vino, man cannot live by bread alone: throw some lettuce, broccoli, and grape tomatoes in a bowl and include salad with meals as a standard side dish.

3.only alcoholic drinks are refilled. two of our party ordered water, two soda, and two alcohol. despite requests, only people drinking alcohol received refills/additional beverages during our meal. both water drinkers and one soda drinker ran completely out of beverage before our meals arrived. the last time the waiter came to the table, we again asked the waiter to refill our water/soda. he nodded in the affirmative and asked ""is everything okay?"" one of the alcohol drinkers boomed ""everything is fantastic!"" maybe the waiter thought that meant we didn't need beverages with our meal after all? we were so thirsty we could not even fairly judge the food. was it tasty? i was too thirsty to tell.",pasta vino rel expens restaur reason expect higher standard say fast food place posit 1 despit fact individu parti respons make reserv done squeez parti six fairli quickli neg 1 rel friend must use wheelchair skip pasta vino one restaur twee demiwal near door sort nearli actual imposs get wheelchair around tabl pack tight could bare walk reach restroom dine area hall restroom separ decor bead curtain appar metal cant imagin anyon wheelchair could possibl use restroom 2 meal stand alon entre veget salad side complimentari bread serv want fill carbpack bread wait meal carbpack pasta one that meanwhil frick cici salad bar extra charg pizza buffet heaven sake pasta vino man cannot live bread alon throw lettuc broccoli grape tomato bowl includ salad meal standard side dish 3onli alcohol drink refil two parti order water two soda two alcohol despit request peopl drink alcohol receiv refillsaddit beverag meal water drinker one soda drinker ran complet beverag meal arriv last time waiter came tabl ask waiter refil watersoda nod affirm ask everyth okay one alcohol drinker boom everyth fantast mayb waiter thought meant didnt need beverag meal thirsti could even fairli judg food tasti thirsti tell

56,e8RyIsdSyFbm5JsuYsF1GA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"i am loathe to talk about what good, authentic italian food this little eatery serves.  too many people might show up and my husband and i could possibly never get a table again.  we stopped in for lunch after an appointment at bangz, hoping to grab a quick bite.  i have to be brutally honest here and say that we almost made a u-turn.  the pastry display was less than half full and there were only four other people in the place, save for the employees.  it seemed a little shabby, frankly speaking.  a caveat here is that we are miamians and accustomed to the glitz of so. beach, coral gables, etc.  that being said, we seated ourselves at a little table and began our journey into the land of deliciousness.  i ordered the tuna azzuro panini.  the ciabatta was fresh and soft, evoo dressed the imported italian tuna with a splash of balsamic, a small sliver of fresh mozzarella and another of avocado.  wonderful in its simplicity.  hubby, being a cheeky fellow, and counting on his italian roots to garner favor with a fellow italian, asked for clams and linguine, though it was not yet the dinner hour.  the chef/owner was very gracious and made it for him.  i had my fork in it before it hit the table!  the pasta was al dente, the clams were fresh and, though it was a garlicky white sauce, there were also some strips of fresh tomato.  i dreamed about it last night...but, i digress.  accompanying my panini were waffle-cut sweet potatoes as soft as a pillow, sans grease.  also, a small side salad with a light dressing.  perfetto.  on a roll, we couldn't stop eating and ordered desserts and an espresso each.  though the desserts..an orange tart and a berry/custard puff pastry..were good, we had already eaten far too much.  now, we cannot wait to return for dinner.  meanwhile, we're taking our ny relatives there for lunch next week.  to sum it up, i would give al bacio a full four stars for the food and three stars for ambience.  bravo!",loath talk good authent italian food littl eateri serv mani peopl might show husband could possibl never get tabl stop lunch appoint bangz hope grab quick bite brutal honest say almost made uturn pastri display less half full four peopl place save employe seem littl shabbi frankli speak caveat miamian accustom glitz beach coral gabl etc said seat littl tabl began journey land delici order tuna azzuro panini ciabatta fresh soft evoo dress import italian tuna splash balsam small sliver fresh mozzarella anoth avocado wonder simplic hubbi cheeki fellow count italian root garner favor fellow italian ask clam linguin though yet dinner hour chefown graciou made fork hit tabl pasta al dent clam fresh though garlicki white sauc also strip fresh tomato dream last nightbut digress accompani panini wafflecut sweet potato soft pillow san greas also small side salad light dress perfetto roll couldnt stop eat order dessert espresso though dessertsan orang tart berrycustard puff pastrywer good alreadi eaten far much cannot wait return dinner meanwhil take ny rel lunch next week sum would give al bacio full four star food three star ambienc bravo

58,TX7voLdPmZ7HMIwIGUOE-Q,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"i've been coming here for years. in fact, this place has been around since i was a little girl, before the internet was huge, and has seen many shops come and go in the little strip mall. i'm told the original owners became too old to care properly for the restaurant anymore, so it's been turned over to a family friend of theirs (and i believe the name/decor changed along with it while the menu didn't budge much). i had the chance to go back last night for a post-birthday dinner with family, and was curious to see if this place that gave me my first taste of mussels was just as good as my tastebuds remembered it.

for such a tiny place and with a cheyenne grill next door, by 7pm it was slammed. not a table remained unfilled, and everyone from elderly couples to families with small children piled into the seats. for all the people inside this small space, it wasn't too loud. my hard of hearing grandfather made out fairly well all things considered, which is rare for him in a restaurant. it seemed like a great place for kids and dates alike, just as i remembered.

the menu had changed a little, though the main feature was still pasta and seafood. i chose the goat cheese and apple ravioli and we all split an order of the fried zucchini and a ceasar salad. the salad was crispy with fresh lettuce and not drowning in dressing while the zucchini was mostly crunchy (though admittedly the bottom of the pile became a little soggy from the juices in the zucchini - still tasted great though!). fresh rolls were brought out every time we emptied the baskets, and every bite was warm and delicious. it took a while for our main meal to come out, but considering we'd just stuffed our faces on bread and salad, it made sense to space it out. people who order just entrees will get them much quicker. i know dine-and-dash is a big thing in american culture, which makes me wonder how people deal with travel to europe...

anyway, my goat cheese and apple ravioli was delicious! the sauce was apple pureed with what seemed like a light cream and the ravioli was filled with cheese. overflowing, even. the salty and the sweet mixed very well together, and i was happy with my choice. everyone else seemed to greatly enjoy their meals as well; in fact, we all had clean plates at the end of dinner which is extremely uncommon in my family. good food = clean plate = full, happy bellies? imagine that.

as long as you're okay with european time, you'll be just fine here. the staff may be ""slow"", but this is a sit-down restaurant. if you're that eager to be in and out of a place, i'm pretty sure pizza hut delivers still... ;) the staff is super friendly and enjoys a good joke with the table. they make you feel like it's a family affair, your mother cooking away in the kitchen at a pace all her own while other family members entertain you. it was very classic italian-style (if you've ever been to italy, you'll know what i mean).

i think is a wonderful place to scope out if you haven't yet. it's a little tucked away and you might not see it right away, but it's well worth hunting it down. considering how long it's been around and how many patrons (my grandparents included) are regulars, it's clearly worthy of trying at least once!",ive come year fact place around sinc littl girl internet huge seen mani shop come go littl strip mall im told origin owner becam old care properli restaur anymor turn famili friend believ namedecor chang along menu didnt budg much chanc go back last night postbirthday dinner famili curiou see place gave first tast mussel good tastebud rememb tini place cheyenn grill next door 7pm slam tabl remain unfil everyon elderli coupl famili small children pile seat peopl insid small space wasnt loud hard hear grandfath made fairli well thing consid rare restaur seem like great place kid date alik rememb menu chang littl though main featur still pasta seafood chose goat chees appl ravioli split order fri zucchini ceasar salad salad crispi fresh lettuc drown dress zucchini mostli crunchi though admittedli bottom pile becam littl soggi juic zucchini still tast great though fresh roll brought everi time empti basket everi bite warm delici took main meal come consid wed stuf face bread salad made sens space peopl order entre get much quicker know dineanddash big thing american cultur make wonder peopl deal travel europ anyway goat chees appl ravioli delici sauc appl pure seem like light cream ravioli fill chees overflow even salti sweet mix well togeth happi choic everyon els seem greatli enjoy meal well fact clean plate end dinner extrem uncommon famili good food clean plate full happi belli imagin long your okay european time youll fine staff may slow sitdown restaur your eager place im pretti sure pizza hut deliv still staff super friendli enjoy good joke tabl make feel like famili affair mother cook away kitchen pace famili member entertain classic italianstyl youv ever itali youll know mean think wonder place scope havent yet littl tuck away might see right away well worth hunt consid long around mani patron grandpar includ regular clearli worthi tri least

60,eiDOIEH8UxfMdiUeuehAew,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"i eat at aragosta quite frequently and love the food and the ambiance, so it seemed only logical to celebrate my birthday - a big one - there as well. i am so glad i did! the entire evening was flawless from end to end. 

we started with cocktails in the hotel lobby, with everyone comfortably arrayed on plush sofas and armchairs around several small tables. no big crowds, no noise (even though there was a big wedding reception going on downstairs there was virtually no spillover), plus plenty of space and room for conversation. our server was wonderful, very personable and attentive, and the wines-by-the-glass were interesting and varied. we had several plates of appetizers delivered to us out there (thanks, chef daniels!), including some delicious meatballs and flatbreads that were promptly devoured by my guests. a perfect starter for the evening. i particularly liked that, even though our dinner reservation was for 7:30 and several people arrived late, which extended the cocktail hour, no one rushed us. they told us to take as much time as we needed, which was handy because, dammit, i had presents to open!

when we finally entered the dining room, i found that they had helped my friend set up the table in advance (she brought several beautiful flower arrangements and they were nicely set out along the table). the atmosphere was perfect. i loved the semi-private seating area - it was a long table that accommodated everyone, set apart from the rest of the dining room by a set of sheer curtains. this made it easy to maneuver from seat to seat, so i could visit with all of my guests, without making anyone feel cramped or cut off from the lovely view or the action in the dining room.

the food was fabulous, as always. i've sampled a number of dishes there, including the bolognese, the sole, and a pork tenderloin special they made once that was out of this world, but for my birthday dinner i decided to go with the steak. it was delicious, and perfectly cooked. once again, the service was superb - all of the dishes came out on time, the pacing was perfect from appetizer through dessert & coffee (they made me a special chocolate torte thingie with a candle), and, once again, no one felt rushed or pressured to wrap up. my friends raved about their meals as well (and this is a picky bunch). 

it just seemed, overall, that everyone at the restaurant - from the hostess to the waitstaff and particularly the folks in the kitchen - knew it was a special night for me and they all worked together to ensure it stayed that way. i could not have been happier with how my evening went and will most definitely be back.",eat aragosta quit frequent love food ambianc seem logic celebr birthday big one well glad entir even flawless end end start cocktail hotel lobbi everyon comfort array plush sofa armchair around sever small tabl big crowd nois even though big wed recept go downstair virtual spillov plu plenti space room convers server wonder person attent winesbytheglass interest vari sever plate appet deliv us thank chef daniel includ delici meatbal flatbread promptli devour guest perfect starter even particularli like even though dinner reserv 730 sever peopl arriv late extend cocktail hour one rush us told us take much time need handi dammit present open final enter dine room found help friend set tabl advanc brought sever beauti flower arrang nice set along tabl atmospher perfect love semipriv seat area long tabl accommod everyon set apart rest dine room set sheer curtain made easi maneuv seat seat could visit guest without make anyon feel cramp cut love view action dine room food fabul alway ive sampl number dish includ bolognes sole pork tenderloin special made world birthday dinner decid go steak delici perfectli cook servic superb dish came time pace perfect appet dessert coffe made special chocol tort thingi candl one felt rush pressur wrap friend rave meal well picki bunch seem overal everyon restaur hostess waitstaff particularli folk kitchen knew special night work togeth ensur stay way could happier even went definit back

63,9hvPt3HErFn_mMeJNMN_LA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,"if it weren't for the outdoor dining, convenient location and complete dearth of remotely decent (non-chain) italian restaurants in atlanta/buckhead, this restaurant would cease to exist. if there was ever a case-study to prove that the lack of competition disadvantages the customer, here it is!  ever since nico sold out, this restaurant has underwhelmed on quality and service and overwhelmed on cost (for what you get)...when your server brings your bill, they should go ahead and complete the mugging experience by dropping the tab while wearing a ski mask.  this restaurant should be endorsed by the democratic party because it clearly operates under a premise that their clientele has entirely too much disposable income and they are here to reconcile that.  the house wines are as mediocre as house wine gets except they are often warm and/or stale and they charge $8 a glass. the santa margherita pinot grigio, for example, goes for $15 a glass while you can easily buy a bottle for under $20 from numerous retailers which begs the question of what their corkage fee is???  
service is commensurate with hostagesque patrons.  servers wait on an assortment of tables inside and outside on the patio which assures a complete lack of continuity but still doesn't explain where they can disappear to for 15-20 minutes at a time.  my guess is they are in a back room laughing their a$$e$ off that the patrons continue to come back...perhaps they should consider rebranding the restaurant as pasta stockholm syndrome.  if my kids weren't complete pasta junkies, i would almost certainly stop touching the hot stove...shame on me.

64,EfO6utXHfqYYio5tTpv5fw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"this review is for the afternoon tea on weekends. i've done this twice now and had a great time both times. 

advice: make a reservation! though it doesn't say this anywhere, and you can still enjoy the food/tea, they want you to make a reservation because apparently it takes an hour to put everything together for this tea. noted for next time.

we were told it was going to be about 45 minutes to prepare the spread so we agreed and sat against the windows. the view of the harbor is nice. we got to see the coast guard ships and people watch the guests arriving via water taxi. the room was chilly (though i'm a naturally cold person so take that for what it's worth) and by the end of the hour, i was cold and hungry and entering into child mode. luckily our food came out shortly after and i forgot about my internal struggle to not start acting like a child because everything was so good! 

i ordered the white orchard tea which is a peach and melon flavored drink. wow. wow wow wow it was awesome!

you get two bites of each item and in total there were 2 pairs of scones, 4 pairs of tea sandwiches, and 3 pairs of desserts. this may not seem like a lot but i was hungry when it came out and i had to pace myself after sampling 3 or 4 of the items. my suggestion, eat all the sandwiches and take home whatever scones and desserts you can't finish. the cream that comes with the scones is amazing. they gave us some to go with our scones and i've been putting it on everything! the vanilla lavender scones are out of this world. other highlights are the prosciutto di parma and brie with fig jam toasts, the cucumber tartine which are very refreshing, and the savory chicken bites. we had some substitutions that weren't listed like a lobster roll (maine style) instead of the egg salad sandwich and these cider cinnamon sugar ""donuts"" which reminded me more of a zeppole than a donut. amazing though.

overall, the food was great and the tea was amazing. come hungry because it's filling despite looking like a small amount (it's not) and make a reservation so you don't have to wait as long as we did!

i went back about a week later for fathers day and again had the goat cheese appetizer which was again the most amazing thing ever.  i had talked so much to my family about how great the lobster fra diavlo was that all four of us got it.  it was just as amazing as the first time i tried it however there was far less lobster meat on it this time around.  the service for both visits were great, i know there are some reviews of poor service on here but i experienced nothing but prompt, friendly and perfect service.  i believe we had a waiter named aldo for our fathers day visit and he was great, very friendly and a very good sense of humor with us.

(for context, this was a saturday night, but restaurant only 2/3 full). my fiance's wine miraculously braved the trip to our table without incident.  my beer unfortunately never made it... 

a bus boy actually then brought out our food in relatively short order.  however, by this point our server had apparently decided her job was done.  no further check-in's, no ""how is everything"", nothing.  which is fine by us, until you need to pay the bill.  at this point the place starts to feel less like a restaurant and more like a prison.  and we needed to get out.  after another 15min with no sign of our server (kidnapped maybe?) we finally just gave our credit card to another staff member.

the table we were seated at was a serious squeeze, behind a table of 4 children ages ~4-10 y/o seated at a separate table next to their parents.  really, we were seated closer to these kids than their parents were. it was truly irritating. 

at no point did the hostess or waiter express any sense of apology for our wait, seating location...or anything.  in fact our waiter maybe said 4 words to us.

my favorites . . . the calamari is a solid starter, just lightly battered with a really good marinara sauce. and almost all rings, which is my personal preference! a delicious tomato bisque, some of the best i've had around here in a very long time. if this is your kind of soup, definitely try theirs. tasty caesar salad, which is always something i lean towards when i'm dining italian. 

the chicken francese is yummy, just lightly battered, and they're happy to let you substitute any noodle you prefer for the come-with (i like linguine best). on the pizza side, it's hard to go wrong, the white pizza is perfect, the margherita is light and tasty with just enough tomato and fresh basil, the prosciutto and arugula is one of my favorites as these are two of my most loved toppings, and the ""works"" is the classic choice with, well, everything on it; the crust is just thin enough and best of all, it's good when you get it but keeps well to be reheated and eaten a day or two later! 

service is friendly and consistent (note: this is a ""neighborhood"" spot, not a fine-dining place, ie, the waiter's likely to ask if you want to try your wine but then incorrectly pour it in the glass of the person who sampled it, not the other person's glass first!) and prices are very reasonable. there can be a wait on fridays and saturdays, but things move fairly quickly. take-out is always a good option.

after i sat down my waitress, coline, came over and asked if i wanted to order a cocktail as i waited. i decided to wait. then after my friend arrived, coline came back and took our drink order. we got a bottle of riesling. it was good. more on the sweet side but coline had wonderful suggestions on what to pair it with. we added on the antipasto for $5. the brie was creamy and melted in my mouth. the cold cuts were amazing! and oh the bread! i love bread and the focaccia was just delectable!

128,NSubWBfM5ZheyhRjKdZJew,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"it is so hard to give a bad review, because the food was excellent. once we got it. the problem was, the service was historically poor. it was very disappointing.

so we were a party of four, heading their on a thursday evening. i called earlier in the week, because we wanted to be outside on the terrace, and was told they don't accept reservations for the terrace. ok, thats fine.

i got there about 730, and the hostess asked we had a reservations. i told her what i had been told, and she replied something to the matter "" well we didn't, and then did take reservations, and didn't. but when people call and ask i just make them anyways""
ok, that seem like a good company policy  one that not all employees know
she said 15-20 minutes maybe for a table. ok, fine. i was waiting for the other three in my part.
well, after an hour goes by, and we are hungry, we get a bottle of wine at the bar and they bring it to us int he lobby. finally, after an hour and 20 minutes, at almost 9 we are told the table should be opening up soon. apparently the guests at the table she thought would have been gone an hour earlier were socializing.

so we went to the table. now dark out, the weather was nice. it is secluded a great spot. we got water, and bread. and no server. after about 15 minutes, we flagged down a server walking by, asking if our server would be coming soon. his reply "" oh, i guess i can help you. do you know what you want""

we ordered a few cheeses to start. then two of the guests got flatbread pizzas for their meal, and the third got a lobster tail app and two sides form the entree list for a meal, i got an entree and a side, and ordered another drink - patron reposado on the rocks. not hard to remember. we asked for all the food to come out at once

so then the flatbreads came out.  then my friends app.  then after a little while my entree and her sides. my side never showed up, and since the server we now had couldn't be found (he didn't bring us the food), i was without.
after we ate, he did come back. i asked him about my side and my drink - and he said he must not have heard me ask for the side, and he "" forgot"" about the drink. and apologized. well, at this point i just wanted to make sure they weren't on the bill.

by this time it was pushing 11 pm, and they were cleaning off the terrace to close up. while we weren't specifically asked, we definitely got the vibe they wanted us to leave. which was fine.

so my meal, the scallops, was amazingly good. the cheeses and bread were great. the wine was good, and everyone enjoyed their food.

but from start to finish, service wise, it was just such a horrible experience. from he long wait, made longer by not having a server, to the order mishaps, to the waiting, and everything. it was pretty much miserable. all four of us have worked in food service, and were appalled by the service. which is really bad, because the food was so tremendous. it is bad that the experience was marred so bad by the staff.

will i try it again? i want to, since the food was good. but i also don't want to end up with the same service in the future.

138,VrRhXseNc64Acz4ejTQDEg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"a group of four of us were in buckhead on a thursday night when one of them was craving pasta, but we didn't know where to go.  per my suggestion, we searched through yelp and came across pasta vino, which was pretty close by.  we trusted that the 4-star average out of 33 reviews shouldn't let us down.

we arrived around 9 pm and were seated immediately.  i was pleased to see that there were at least two other tables of customers dining at the time.  the server gave us the regular dinner menus and also sheets of paper displaying their specials.

after glancing at the menu, i decided to get my favorite italian pasta dish as a ""create your own pasta"" - fettuccine with alfredo sauce and chicken.  since i wasn't very hungry, i was pleased to see that they offered two sizes for the pastas - small plate or dinner portion.  after asking the server to describe the small plate size vs. the dinner portion size, i chose the small plate.  to add chicken to a pasta dish, it's usually a $4 charge for the dinner portion.  however, the server informed me that i could add a ""half"" portion of chicken for my small plate for a $2 charge.

while we waited for our food to be prepared, the server brought out a basket of complimentary dinner rolls with butter.  the bread tasted fresh and delicious with the butter, but my friends and i thought it would have been amazing if it was served warm instead of room temperature.  after we finished our first basket, we requested more bread, and the server had no problem getting us some more.

thankfully, it didn't take much time for our food to be prepared and served to us.

* fettuccine with alfredo sauce and chicken (small plate - $9, 1/2 portion of chicken - $2) - the portion of the ""small plate"" was pretty much on par with how the server had described it.  i was satisfied with the portion of chicken in the small plate, happy with the amount of sauce on my fettuccine noodles, and thought it tasted good.  it was probably a little better than olive garden's but wasn't as good as mirko pasta's fettuccine alfredo.  however, i found myself wishing that the fettuccine noodles were wider because they were pretty narrow in size.  although i didn't finish my small plate and took my leftovers home, i think it's a good size for one person - especially if you are eating the dinner rolls.

overall, pasta vino gets 3.5 stars for their good pasta and friendly service.  however, i didn't find anything particularly unique about the restaurant that would encourage me to return and try their other foods.  if you happen to be in the area and want pasta, pasta vino will satisfy the craving, but i wouldn't expect anything really special.

139,z-zCbssa-MwU-wI_5aWT6A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"finally, a waterfront restaurant that isn't a tourist trap! i'm usually wary of hotel restaurants too as they traditionally cater to the overly pampered vacationers and are often served with a side of sell-out. but not aragosta!

for starters, loved the calamari salad. loved that they served the calamari rings cold and as is, without covering them in greasy breading. the chilled chewy rings were the best rings a girl could wish for, and the calamari is a girl's best friend at aragosta.

my entrã©e was the fluke. the fish was flaky-fresh, not too heavily seasoned to just appreciate the pure flavor. my dining companion had the herb roasted organic chicken, a classy, no frills dish. the chicken was juicy with a nice roasted flavor, and i was told that the mushroom polenta was also quite good. 

my fave part of the meal was the dessert, which rarely happens. the refreshing olive oil cake has a refreshing lemon citrus flavor and cold creamy strawberry ice cream. yummm!!!

aragosta may be the only place i've ever been to where the quality of the food has absolutely nothing to do with its rating on yelp. it's currently averaging a measly 3 stars, which is sadly a step up from the 2.5 at the time of my reservation. i read the reviews, and it seems that many of the poor reviews were based solely on service. if the service was poor at some point in time, i can assure you that it has been fully remedied since then. so if it's good food you're looking for, i urge you to give aragosta a chance, and i beg you to write a positive review so that this waterfront gem will have a rating that reflects it's top-notch food!",final waterfront restaur isnt tourist trap im usual wari hotel restaur tradit cater overli pamper vacation often serv side sellout aragosta starter love calamari salad love serv calamari ring cold without cover greasi bread chill chewi ring best ring girl could wish calamari girl best friend aragosta entrã e fluke fish flakyfresh heavili season appreci pure flavor dine companion herb roast organ chicken classi frill dish chicken juici nice roast flavor told mushroom polenta also quit good fave part meal dessert rare happen refresh oliv oil cake refresh lemon citru flavor cold creami strawberri ice cream yummm aragosta may place ive ever qualiti food absolut noth rate yelp current averag measli 3 star sadli step 25 time reserv read review seem mani poor review base sole servic servic poor point time assur fulli remedi sinc good food your look urg give aragosta chanc beg write posit review waterfront gem rate reflect topnotch food

the inside was quiet for a friday night, which was great for the boyfriend and i. the atmosphere was cozy and romantic, reminding me very much of restaurants in europe. the servers were very friendly and attentive. they brought by the delicious warm bread with olive oil and cheese frequently and made sure our drinks never got too low. 

do note that the menu they have does not include everything they offer. in addition to their fixed menu, they do have a daily menu that you can ask to see. i got this tip from yelp reviews which was helpful for me because my boyfriend wanted lasagna which wasn't on the menu. the waiter happily noted they did have it and that it was freshly baked earlier today. i ended up choosing the classic chicken parmesan with spaghetti and it did not disappoint.

145,seS7WcMLEWV0fTnzhl03Cw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"i came with my expectations in check after reading some mixed reviews here on yelp but men, i was pleasantly surprised. we had reservations for the terrace but it was nippy and they sat us inside promptly. i found the service all through the night exceptional and not lacking in any way. the waiters were courteous and frequently checked in to make sure we were satisfied.

 the atmosphere is definitely upscale but we didn't find it overly snubby or elitist, just nice and comfy. the place was spic span and shiny, definitely well maintained. the bathrooms were really nice as well, a very nice touch all around. the restaurant is at the base of the fairmont hotel (which we didn't know) but that wasn't an issue. valet parking for less than you would pay to park yourself. 

we tried a few things off the menu....lamb meatballs & aragosta insalata to start. the meatballs were glorious and the platter was also quite tasty (apart for the mustard sauce thing, yuck, that was pretty much the only bite that wasn't 4-5-star all night). we had the lobster tagliatelle and roasted chicken both of which were awesome (though i didn't like the balsamic sauce mixed with the corn and squash). we finished off with the tiramisu....if not for anything else we ate, that heavenly tiramisu was worth the entire dinner and $100+ tab :). absolutely the best tiramisu we have ever had. try it and you will surely not be disappointed.

 the only negative thing i have to say about aragosta is that the service did seem a bit slow. while the waiters were great and frequently checked on us, it took almost an hour to actually get our main courses from when we sat down and the place was about 70-80% full so not terribly busy. though the apps came out fairly quick. 

 right next door is the battery lounge, the live jazz band came on around 9pm. it was quite pleasant to have that going in the background while having dinner. and while we didn't stick around long after dinner in the lounge, the place was full of after-dinner patrons just soaking in the nice music with drinks. very nice. i will definitely be going back to aragosta, i also like it is in a 'quieter' section of the north end away from all the chaos.",came expect check read mix review yelp men pleasantli surpris reserv terrac nippi sat us insid promptli found servic night except lack way waiter courteou frequent check make sure satisfi atmospher definit upscal didnt find overli snubbi elitist nice comfi place spic span shini definit well maintain bathroom realli nice well nice touch around restaur base fairmont hotel didnt know wasnt issu valet park less would pay park tri thing menulamb meatbal aragosta insalata start meatbal gloriou platter also quit tasti apart mustard sauc thing yuck pretti much bite wasnt 45star night lobster tagliatel roast chicken awesom though didnt like balsam sauc mix corn squash finish tiramisuif anyth els ate heavenli tiramisu worth entir dinner 100 tab absolut best tiramisu ever tri sure disappoint neg thing say aragosta servic seem bit slow waiter great frequent check us took almost hour actual get main cours sat place 7080 full terribl busi though app came fairli quick right next door batteri loung live jazz band came around 9pm quit pleasant go background dinner didnt stick around long dinner loung place full afterdinn patron soak nice music drink nice definit go back aragosta also like quieter section north end away chao

the service here is really quite impeccable. from host to server, everyone was fantastic. we came on a slower evening, so the bartender was also our server (pat). we opted to stick with prosecco during our meal (super girly, i know). he was really sweet and later on, he offered us complimentary dessert wine with our last course. while i don't have a taste for dessert wines, this one paired really well with what we chose. 

as for the meals, my friend ordered the caesar salad for her first course, and i opted for the mixed greens with poached egg. the salads were pretty big in portion. the tomatoes on my salad were incredibly juicy, the egg was nicely poached, and it had a lovely reduction on it. 

for our second course, we both opted for the bolognese. it was slightly different from most i've had, but the rigatoni was al dente, the meat was nicely cooked, and the creaminess was just the right consistency. i also thought the portion was just perfect. i usually don't order pasta when i go out to eat because i hardly make a dent in it before i'm full. this was a great portion size for a 3-course, leaving me with just enough room for dessert. my only complaint was the meat-to-pasta ratio. my girlfriend and i both agreed that we could have done with a few more rigatonis, and just a tablespoon or so less of the bolognese. otherwise, it was really delicious. 

for dessert, she ordered the crã¨me brã»lã©e, and i ordered the tiramisu. both were served with a few pieces of biscotti (which i loved). the tiramisu was moist and melted in my mouth, and it came with a scoop of coffee gelato, so it was total heaven. 

all in all, i would say this makes for a good spot to go on a more intimate date. i would definitely come back here with my boyfriend. the views are gorgeous, the service is on par, and the food is comparable in quality to most north end locales. i can definitely see myself coming here after work in the summer and enjoying a drink outside on the wharf, as well.",im sure place doesnt better review went last night work littl girl night run dine boston pre fix first thing first place huge decid seat front loung tabl window view gorgeou made nice set servic realli quit impecc host server everyon fantast came slower even bartend also server pat opt stick prosecco meal super girli know realli sweet later offer us complimentari dessert wine last cours dont tast dessert wine one pair realli well chose meal friend order caesar salad first cours opt mix green poach egg salad pretti big portion tomato salad incred juici egg nice poach love reduct second cours opt bolognes slightli differ ive rigatoni al dent meat nice cook creami right consist also thought portion perfect usual dont order pasta go eat hardli make dent im full great portion size 3cours leav enough room dessert complaint meattopasta ratio girlfriend agre could done rigatoni tablespoon less bolognes otherwis realli delici dessert order crã brã lã e order tiramisu serv piec biscotti love tiramisu moist melt mouth came scoop coffe gelato total heaven would say make good spot go intim date would definit come back boyfriend view gorgeou servic par food compar qualiti north end local definit see come work summer enjoy drink outsid wharf well

i really wanted to give a good review, but lots of inconsistency at my table. i actually thought the spaghetti and meatballs was great; the sauce was delicious. boyfriend got the rigatoni with italian sausage; it looked good, but i didn't try it. mom got the chicken marsala; the chicken was tough and the sauce wasn't very recognizable as masala.

they ended up taking the chicken off the bill (when we said they really didn't have to). kudos for that.

the house chianti is not very good.

food - exceeded beyond my expectations. the lobster crostini was sooo yummy, delicious and had such juicy pieces of lobster complimented with the taste of truffle. charred octopus salad was served with pieces of fingerling potatoes done perfectly. personally, i love the bitterness from the charred octopus though some may not be a fan. we had the pappardelle bolognese, veal cheek & ox tail ragu main to share and they politely split into two plates. they definitely came looking as if it was one portion each! topped off with a piece of melting brie cheese on a rolled up piece of pasta standing in the ragu, i was very impressed with the presentation (not to mention that the pasta was thoughtfully seasoned in between with herbs and cheese.)

dessert was okay but we only ordered gelato. the bread pudding looked good but we were too stuffed to try anything else.

all in all, great food, great service for my experience. honestly i felt really bad at the end of my dining experience that we were the only people dining in this restaurant. i mean for this quality of food, there should be more people!!! my four stars might not be enough to salvage their current 2 star average - but if you happen to stay at fairmont hotel and happen to read this, give them a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised.",feel bad aragosta deserv star definit good experi hope review convinc peopl shun away restaur due star rate anyon start think one worker aragosta fairmont hotel came boston new york mlk long weekend boyfriend decid conveni avoid 7 degre weather dine restaur disappoint servic seem problem review serious someon judg restaur base food servic nevertheless waiter serv us perfectli polit knowledg menu gave us food recommend attent entir time food exceed beyond expect lobster crostini sooo yummi delici juici piec lobster compliment tast truffl char octopu salad serv piec fingerl potato done perfectli person love bitter char octopu though may fan pappardel bolognes veal cheek ox tail ragu main share polit split two plate definit came look one portion top piec melt brie chees roll piec pasta stand ragu impress present mention pasta thought season herb chees dessert okay order gelato bread pud look good stuf tri anyth els great food great servic experi honestli felt realli bad end dine experi peopl dine restaur mean qualiti food peopl four star might enough salvag current 2 star averag happen stay fairmont hotel happen read give shot might pleasantli surpris

i ordered the herb-roasted chicken with polenta, and after a thorough salt and peppering it was much better -- does no one season their food any more? the chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. i also got a side of the fries, which were absolute heaven. they're fried in duck fat and come with a side of aioli, so they're not for the faint of heart. there was a generous portion of them and i barely made a dent, but honestly they were perfection. 

the major drawbacks were alcohol-related, being that our waiter did not know how to properly pour a beer (they bring the glass and bottle to the table and do it for you), all of our glasses had about 2 inches of foam. the other was the wine pour: for $9, you get two ounces of wine. words cannot explain my dismay. quite beyond the pale.

for a restaurant that purports itself as fine dining, the waitress hardly had any recommendations, the portion sizes were small, and the food just wasn't outstanding. further, the food took a really long time to come out and they forgot stuff we ordered.  it's one thing if the place is very busy, but it was empty and there was at least 1 wait staff to 1 customer.  again, just seemed a bit unexpected for that caliber of restaurant.  the prices also where high and collectively, that's a combo that doesn't work for most people.

252,j_nslJRMkiB3ytCKAuvQog,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"i have been to aragosta now on four separate occasions, and am glad to have such a wonderful spot in the north end neighborhood. 

my first time here was for some drinks and apps on their patio this past summer. we had a nice, relaxing time and were even privy to have a beautiful firework show on the water. the drinks were good, but the zeppoles for desert were my favorite. 

the next time i was here was for a neighborhood fundraiser (ruff) and it was wonderful. the lounge it was held in was beautiful. perfect space for this event and it was even complete with a jazz band playing that evening. the waiter for the event was a bit of grump though... 

my husband and i were impressed with the menu and came back for dinner soon after. i started with the lobster popover - which was supposed to only be available in the lounge, but they made an exception as this is why i went there that evening. it was good - not as great as i expected though. it had a bit too much of sauce in it for my taste. for dinner i had the herb roasted organic chicken with exotic mushroom polenta, and broccoli rabe. it was amazing! the chicken was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. the polenta was creamy with just the right amount of mushrooms - i am a hard critic on polenta.. i have never like polenta outside of the kind my italian family makes.  for desert - you guessed it those delish zeppoles. our waiter was great, as he convinced them to make an exception for the lobster popover - i will remember next time that they have separate menus:) 

most recently i was there for the north end library fundraiser and had a great time. the hors d'oeuvres were great and the space downstairs was fantastic. the bartenders were not a friendly as i would have hoped - but they were efficient and got us our drinks. 

one thing i did notice is that the decor in the restaurant does not match the classiness of the lounge or patio. the decor reminds me something of the dining room of a cruise ship... but this can be overlooked for great food and drinks.

thankfully, our experience this time was an order of magnitude nicer and more civilized.  we sat at the chef's table, watched our wellfleet oysters get shucked, our fresh squid get battered and fried, and our glasses stay full from the bottle of ""good-enough"" prosecco supplied as part of the gilt deal.  we would have left after that feeling pretty okay with the experience, but theo, the chef working that day, decided to make a reasonably nice experience a really lovely experience.  we talked with him a bit about his background and his passion for food came through in a way that made two aging foodies smile.  he gave us some duck prosciutto to try and some new england-sourced goat cheese, too.  we left happier than when we went in.  we called the day a success...

crab cakes - great quality. fresh and price appropriate. good size. larger than average i would say. 

calamari - i love calamari, but this didn't really appeal to me. something about the breading. cracked black pepper was a good addition. think i would have preferred them more crispy. they are however, served over an amazing remoulade with a touch of spice.

truffle fries - great basket of fries.  can be eaten alone.  no ketchup. the shaved parmesan really sets it off.

i'll keep this in list form for simplicity and brevity.

- upon entering, we were completely ignored by the girl manning the register. no hostess?
- we were eventually given two glasses of water for the four of us, with a promise of two more glasses to come. we waited and waited... and finally had to catch his eye before he remembered us.
- bread basket contained rolls that were over-baked and too hard on the outside.
- calamari was completely tasteless and pale in color.
- i ordered linguine with clams. i received 12 fresh clams, all right, on top of fettucine. not linguine. it was extremely bland.
- bf got smoked salmon alfredo. it was linguine (don't alfredos use fettucine? maybe they mixed up our pastas) completely smothered in this rich (and not in a good way) sauce. the smoked salmon was incredibly salty. so of course, that made the entire dish a salty, creamy mess.
- neither of our two tablemates were happy with their dishes either. one got a chicken breast on top of greens. he commented that his salad was incredibly oily and the leaves were wilted due to the hot pieces of chicken being placed directly on top of the salad. the other had mediterranean gnocchi and commented it was also bland and very starchy.
- they do not allow separate checks. when we attempted to pay with separate cards anyway, our server asked us to go up to the register to ""ensure that everything gets split up correctly."" really? three cards too much to handle?

on top of it, we were treated to a show of rambunctious kids running around, yelling their faces off. their parents were dining at the restaurant next to us. this has nothing to do with pv of course, but only added to our already bad dining experience.",usual dislik restaur food servic may make vice versa pasta vino case struck ill keep list form simplic breviti upon enter complet ignor girl man regist hostess eventu given two glass water four us promis two glass come wait wait final catch eye rememb us bread basket contain roll overbak hard outsid calamari complet tasteless pale color order linguin clam receiv 12 fresh clam right top fettucin linguin extrem bland bf got smoke salmon alfredo linguin dont alfredo use fettucin mayb mix pasta complet smother rich good way sauc smoke salmon incred salti cours made entir dish salti creami mess neither two tablem happi dish either one got chicken breast top green comment salad incred oili leav wilt due hot piec chicken place directli top salad mediterranean gnocchi comment also bland starchi allow separ check attempt pay separ card anyway server ask us go regist ensur everyth get split correctli realli three card much handl top treat show rambuncti kid run around yell face parent dine restaur next us noth pv cours ad alreadi bad dine experi

we were seated and ordered two pasta dishes. both delicious but extremely small. we were starving and had to order more bread.

unfortunately, i was unable to reach the restaurant to make a reservation, so i showed up 15 minutes early hoping for a table for 15 people for a 6:30 dinner on a weekday.  luckily, the server was extremely helpful and was able to set me up a table right away.  slowly my party started to arrive.

speaking of slow, my only gripe about this place was that service was a bit slow in getting drinks, etc.  however, we were a surprise large group and there were only 2 servers working at the time.  so i won't count it against them.  out server was very nice, made recommendations to anyone that asked, and always made sure our waters were filled.

the menu has so many amazing options on it.  i had a very hard time deciding what i was going to eat.  i ultimately decided on a side caesar salad and the carbonara with parpadelle pasta, which was recommended by my waiter as the parpadelle would soak up all of the sauce and really make the dish.  everyone at the table got something different and it was fun to see everything come out, as all of the dishes were presented beautifully.  

my caesar salad was very simple, but good.  i thought the dressing was tasty, however i tend to enjoy the creamy caesar dressing rather than the oil based that on the salad, but that's just preference.  my carbonara pasta was great!  the noodles seemed to be homemade, definitely soaked up the delicious rich sauce, and the pancetta was crispy and offered a wonderful smoky taste to the dish.  i had the privilege of trying my friend's dish next to me, which was the parpadelle that had a white wine cream sauce, asparagus, and italian sausage.  i actually enjoyed that one more than mine, but they are two completely different dishes so it's hard to say one is better than the other in that sense.

299,WTzycZQI7SZwvs5YG4mFXA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"i'm having trouble deciding on how many stars to give this rating... on the one hand, i would give high marks for atmosphere (we sat out on the terrace, at a fire pit table, on a gorgeous bright late summer/early autumn day) - it was so peaceful and beautiful, we hardly felt like we were in downtown boston.  however, the food didn't really impress the way i thought it would.  this might be because i went there with my boyfriend for their ""weekend clambake"" specials, but i was using a voucher from gilt city (like groupon, for those who aren't familiar).  

i think we got ripped off, quite frankly.  the normal meal is supposed to be $35 a person - and they supposedly serve you a lobster, clams, mussels, potatoes, corn on the cob, and chorizo, plus cornbread and watermelon.  seems reasonable, right?  with the voucher however, you are suckered into thinking you're getting a great deal because they sell you a ""clambake for two"" for a total price of $49.  this includes two sam adams summer beers.  what they *don't* tell you is that you actually only will be served a single portion of food that you have to share with your other dining companion.  true, you do each get your own beer, your own small triangle of watermelon, and your own tiny wedge of cornbread, but the main course is still just one plate with a lobster, a few clams and mussels, the equivalent of a half a corn cob,
and maybe three fingerling potatoes - that you both will have to share!?

so essentially, you are still paying 50 bucks for one small lobster and a few clams/mussels (i think there was a total of 9 or 10 between them).  this would be just enough to satisfy one person, but it was definitely not enough food for two people.  and definitely not worth $50.  plus, we were expected to tip on what they tell you the total would have cost had you not used your voucher - they claim the entire meal would have been $70 (again remember we are talking one small lobster, and about 4 clams, 4-6 mussels, plus 2 fingerling potatoes).  total rip off.

i don't know who is to blame for this - aragosta, or gilt city?  one of them was not being totally honest when they advertised this deal.  it was no deal at all...

the food that was being delivered to other tables definitely looked delicious, so i might still return - but i will definitely never purchase anything else from gilt city in the future.  i've been totally burned by them too many times now.",im troubl decid mani star give rate one hand would give high mark atmospher sat terrac fire pit tabl gorgeou bright late summerearli autumn day peac beauti hardli felt like downtown boston howev food didnt realli impress way thought would might went boyfriend weekend clambak special use voucher gilt citi like groupon arent familiar think got rip quit frankli normal meal suppos 35 person supposedli serv lobster clam mussel potato corn cob chorizo plu cornbread watermelon seem reason right voucher howev sucker think your get great deal sell clambak two total price 49 includ two sam adam summer beer dont tell actual serv singl portion food share dine companion true get beer small triangl watermelon tini wedg cornbread main cours still one plate lobster clam mussel equival half corn cob mayb three fingerl potato share essenti still pay 50 buck one small lobster clamsmussel think total 9 10 would enough satisfi one person definit enough food two peopl definit worth 50 plu expect tip tell total would cost use voucher claim entir meal would 70 rememb talk one small lobster 4 clam 46 mussel plu 2 fingerl potato total rip dont know blame aragosta gilt citi one total honest advertis deal deal food deliv tabl definit look delici might still return definit never purchas anyth els gilt citi futur ive total burn mani time

main plates mostly range from $21 - $33 and while there are many tempting starters, i would suggest trying aragosta's shared plate of meats, cheese and fish for $29.  the platter was more than enough for our party of four and was a delicious beginning to our meal.

i was tempted to try chef daniels daughter's favorite plate, orecchiette d'olivia, lobster ""mac & cheese"", but i opted for the ""piatti di giorno"", which was veal parmesan.  this is a staple plate at any italian restaurant and a personal favorite.  the red sauce was fresh and flavorful and combined nicely with the perfectly prepared veal; it was my very definition of comfort food. the one blemish to the dining experience was the lack of experience from our well-meaning but clearly green waitress.  when questioned about the menu her responses were stilted and unsure and when glasses ran empty she was slow to recognize or show herself to reorder another bottle (perhaps that's best - it did save us some money).

325,QKioZ7NKRo7oORQl8rKvUA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"four of us came in for dinner on saturday night and had such a terrible experience i had to provide feedback. all of us are young (mid thirties) successful professionals, who live in the city and dine out roughly 2 -3 times a week. we consider ourselves ""foodies"" we are well travelled and we have a high taste level (however not so much that we are snobby). 

 
when we arrived we checked in at the hostess stand (we had reservations). it should be noted that the hostess stand had a lot of commotion for what appreared to be a slow night.  they had quite a number of staff standing there, however no one could help me but the hostess, this created immediate confusion and a poor first impression. we opted to wait for a table outside, and had drinks while we waited at the bar, but after a long time we noticed that although many ""4tops"" were free and we had to flag down the hostess to remind her we were waiting and she then remembered and brought us outside to our seat. it should be noted that the hostess seemed very inexperienceds and scattered for a slow night..... she should have come over to us to tell us how long it would be and that our table was waiting.


once we sat our ""food"" waiter introduced himself to us and told us that we could not order drinks with him but that we had a ""drink"" waitress and she would be right over. really? is this what they want? to have guests seated by someone that tells you what they cannot do? ok... so we waited and waited for our ""drink"" waitress and after well over 10 minutes (we were frustrated) she came over. once we ordered our wine and drinks our ""food"" waiter came over... without bringing you through the entire meal and all of the times he was inappropriate and annoying i will just say this, he was the worst waiter we have ever had... keeping in mind that we have all dined out extensively both in the united states and abroad. he was obtuse, rude and rushed us our entire dinner. he harassed us to order, appetizers then dinner .... (came back incessantly, when we clearly were trying to talk and have a leisurely dinner), he didn't asked for the woman's orders first he just kind of went around the table.. (manners?! ladies are always first)... he cleared plates before everyone was finished (!! this is waiting tables 101...) and at one point (at 9:30) told us that the patio closes at 11 and that we had better order our entrees because at 11 we had to get off the patio. really? do guests want to be troubled by restaurant rules? if it is 9:30 and guests have till 11... surely they have enough time to eat and not be bothered w/ rules and feel like they are being rushed... at the end of our dinner when all but on person's plates were cleared (ugh!)... he came over to our friend once and asked to clear his plate... our friend was in the middle of telling a story and said politely no, he was not ready for it to be cleared. then not even 5 minutes later he came back again and asked to clear it - our friend was still not done! but out of frustration said - ""yes - just take my plate!"" and instead of ordering more wine, after dinner drinks and dessert, we settled up, and went elsewhere. vowing that regardless of a great view and just so-so food...

349,ipgTl8weZiLS-1bpktNC4g,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"not our first choice, on a friday night in atl, but we did find pasta vino while out looking for dinner, and fortunately they had at least one available table for us, which we happily decided to take.  

staff were quick to get us our water and complimentary bread.  i thought it was interesting that the bread came with butter and while olive oil was on the table, it wasn't poured for the bread, like so many other italian places do.  no worries though, as i had hands and could pour my own.

after going back and forth on the menu, and having the menu and some of their best selling dishes on the menu pointed out to us, we ordered the following:

goat cheese & apple ravioli ($17)
minestrone zuppe ($7)
lamb bolognese parpardelle ($18)

starting with the minestrone, the soup came in a cup, and it wasn't bad...it sorta sits in the middle of the road in terms of minestrones i've had.

the lamb bolognese parpardelle wasn't my dish, but i had a couple of tastes of it, and the flavor was there.  very potent flavors, soft noodles, yummy!  this was the star dish of the night for me, although it was funny that it seemed we liked each other's dishes better than our own.

the goat cheese & apple ravioli was fantastic with the first bite, but then it got creamy.  real creamy.  over the ravioli was an apple glaze that made the ravioli apple sweet, and that sweetness cut into the super rich goat cheese, stuffed into the ravioli.  i'm not a huge fan of goat cheese myself, but if you love goat cheese, this dish may be yours to order.  for me, if the apple glaze was not there, i could not have finished it, and in fact, i didn't finish the ravioli, leaving a few behind.  

customer service was just fine here, minus the innocent and mistaken slap they gave to my date, who took it in stride.  service was generally fast, having the soup come out within 5 minutes of ordering, and entrees just a few minutes later.  this place is more on the intimate side, having room to seat maybe 30 people inside, although there is patio seating as well.

located in a restaurant strip, parking isn't an issue here, though you likely wont get any parking right in front of the restaurant, but that's okay.  there is also at least one red light exit as well.

if i'm being honest, i'd give pasta vino a 3.5, and i'd round them up to 4 because they had juuuuust enough flavor to make it.  would i come back?  sure.  i'd give them a chance to truly earn their 4 stars by selecting another dish that may be not as rich for my tastebuds.  i hope i get to try them again soon.",first choic friday night atl find pasta vino look dinner fortun least one avail tabl us happili decid take staff quick get us water complimentari bread thought interest bread came butter oliv oil tabl wasnt pour bread like mani italian place worri though hand could pour go back forth menu menu best sell dish menu point us order follow goat chees appl ravioli 17 minestron zupp 7 lamb bolognes parpardel 18 start minestron soup came cup wasnt badit sorta sit middl road term minestron ive lamb bolognes parpardel wasnt dish coupl tast flavor potent flavor soft noodl yummi star dish night although funni seem like other dish better goat chees appl ravioli fantast first bite got creami real creami ravioli appl glaze made ravioli appl sweet sweet cut super rich goat chees stuf ravioli im huge fan goat chees love goat chees dish may order appl glaze could finish fact didnt finish ravioli leav behind custom servic fine minu innoc mistaken slap gave date took stride servic gener fast soup come within 5 minut order entre minut later place intim side room seat mayb 30 peopl insid although patio seat well locat restaur strip park isnt issu though like wont get park right front restaur that okay also least one red light exit well im honest id give pasta vino 35 id round 4 juuuuust enough flavor make would come back sure id give chanc truli earn 4 star select anoth dish may rich tastebud hope get tri soon
