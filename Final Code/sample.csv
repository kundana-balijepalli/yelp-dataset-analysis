z_VY1RNU2nWO6kaAVt28nw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Great food. Recommend the grilled shrimp app, white bean soup, Brussels sprouts, risotto, and lamb. Great wine selection and interesting cocktail menu. 

Good service. Friendly hostess and server. Good wine presentation. Nice outdoor seating. 

The fire pits outside are fabulous and offer something different. Call ahead to reserve one. Upscale ambience."
iz89hnkkU5MXSvODiIKiaA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"There is definitely a wow factor when you enter the restaurant from the hotel.  The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a ""different"" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.  In the future, I'd like to eat outside as the seating is on the water."
T8vxPxV_0Nvh7T9G7zfE8A,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"My boyfriend took me here the last time I was visiting him in the John's Creek area. He told me it was his favorite restaurant, and I can see why! The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. The prices were reasonable, and comparative to other Italian restaurants. The portions were HUGE! In my opinion - a major plus. I got the ziti, and had enough left over for two more meals. It was the best ziti I've ever had! Highly recommended."
LSvhBCb8q0tytFd1x4eB3A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Food was great. 
Service was great. 
Bartender spilled a dark drink on my friends white pants (gasp!) but the manager immediately and without request came over and asked for her info in order to receive her dry cleaning bill.  Super great customer service.  
Though it's expensive you know what you're getting into when you go to the hotel.  I'll go back for sure!"
Kv9VEmLpM285jD8SVVqUPw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"We went for afternoon tea and pasties on Sunday... We had called earlier that week for reservations. Upon arriving they had no reservations for us in their system. We waited about 5 minutes while the hostess ""was checking""  all along 4-5 empty tables existed. We were seated for a good 10 more minutes before any wait staff brought us menus. From there, another 10 minutes before ordering (it was very slow), and then the tea and pastries came. The tiniest assortment and 1 French press of tea for $45/person. What a major rip off, and the pastries were mediocre at best in taste. The waitress never came back, not even once to offer more tea or anything. Poor food, poor service, highly priced ! For $90+ tip we could of had a lunch in the North End and all the cannolis we can stomach! Won't be back :("
aglpU--vi76j2r3BEdmolA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"I went there last night...we were outside on the patio, good view and ambiance, good food but so many Rats running around .. after a woman started to scream, I left !! It is not at all acceptable having rats in a dining area!"
uo-O3xXjKWGXB93k7RwBgg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I always get a little wary when I see a 2-2.5 star rating for a business.

One stars are usually self-explanatory. It's a terrible establishment. But a 2-2.5 star rating with a varied mix of 1-star and 4- and 5-star reviews hints at more going on. Like maybe a business going through a bad period that had previously been good. Or vice versa. Either way, there's more to the story than just simply being a poor business.

It was with this reasoning that I went to Aragosta for Restaurant Week. I had read the reviews beforehand and prepared myself for the worst. It never came.

The food was exceptionally good, much better than I would have expected. The calamari appetizer was fresh and delicious. It was not fried, which is a welcome change, and the calamari pieces were tender and chewy all at once, served with an olive paste and tomato sauce under a bed of bitter greens. The flavors and textures complemented each other perfectly. The dish felt refreshing and satisfying without being the least bit slimy or rich.

My friend got the fish next and I decided on the chicken. I normally never get chicken as an entree but it came with an exotic mushroom polenta and I figured I had to try that. I also felt the other options were too boring (mostly pastas). The chicken was quite good, if a little dry in parts and the polenta definitely satisfied. There was so much food, I ended up having to take half home.

The olive oil cake was a real winner. I've had olive oil cake before and loved it but my friend had never had it so I was excited for her to try it. Just like me, she loved it. The cake was soft, moist and flavorful, perfectly complemented by the light strawberry-flavored ice-cream it was served with. Delicious.

For drinks, I had the Whiskey Cobbler. I normally don't like whiskey as a mixer but they used Crown Royal and fresh fruit juice and the combination was fantastic. Their drinks are pricey, often around $15 a pop for not very unusual creations, so this might not be the place to go for lots of cocktails.

Now, I've noticed a lot of the 1-star reviews for Aragosta have to do with poor service. Obviously, someone in management was paying attention because the service we experienced was excellent. 

There was one bad moment in the beginning of our meal when our waiter decided to explain the menu line by line. As in comment on each dish in the menu, one after another. There were a lot of dishes. I am not a patient person and I hate it when people do things like hand you a piece of paper and make you read it aloud with them, which is what this was like. So I politely cut him off as quickly as I could and told him we'd just be doing the Restaurant Week menu (which we'd already told him). Other than that, though, he was attentive and friendly. The hostess was also very nice and everyone seemed like they genuinely wanted you to be there, which is always a great feeling.

The decor contains the best parts of the previous restaurant Sensing, which I had the pleasure of also experiencing. The curtains are still there along with the wide windows, giving the place a breezy, al fresco feel. Different parts of the restaurant have different lighting and we were seated in a particularly dim part, between two curtains. Very moody and romantic but I must say it was almost a little too dim to read the menu and the curtain next to us did little to protect us from the obnoxiously loud party of 6 drunken women beside us. If you're here on a date night, ask to be seated in a corner, NOT by a curtain."
dncq4ag15doR-G7uDKhaJw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Another one on my fav list and what a better way to start an early Sunday morning....having a nice breakfast in this place with a perfect hot café con leche!!
Then just a nice and quiet stroll in the park!!
Clean and simple decor, the staff is great very friendly. Awesome customer service!
I love the pastas, soups and sandwiches but the best of all are my venezuela's treats, cachitos, tequeños, empanadas, and for the month of December our traditional Pan de jamón, so good!!"
Be-2UIdklRMNMieXoTN8gQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Pasta Vino started out as Broadway Danny's years and years ago then changed ownership to become a bit more upscale.  The food is usually always good, but the service is usually always mediocre.  Regardless of the service, I continue to come back again and again because they make a great pizza (just be sure to ask for it extra thin and extra crispy!) and they have an excellent lasagna.  The meatballs are very good as well.  This is the only  casual Italian joint in Atlanta that I would recommend!  I always feel like you get your moneys worth here."
yc9uxICf7hb0LPfjQteAIg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Portion size is good and staff is friendly with a cool atmosphere. 
BUT I ordered a goat cheese pasta dish that was more like milk and nutmeg with little goat cheese flavor. Very runny and very nutmeggy. 
I ordered a regular glass of cab and it was terrible and I don't even know much about wine. 

Overalls my friend and I had a less than desirable experience despite the lovely atmosphere. I am only writing this because now 2 and a half hours later I am VERY SICK. My stomach is in knots and I feel nauseated. 

If you go sit outside and order a pizza or something"
QEWjGuTEraWgBgWr4RscwA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Who doesn't love pasta & garlic bread. Noms. I would happily sell a sibling for a double helping of those buttery, garlic covered, carbolicious garlic knots. And the goat cheese & apple ravioli will secretly leave you wishing is was appropriate to eat 10 ravioli and not just 3. 

So...if it's such great food, why the ""Meh"" rating? 

The drink menu leaves much to be desired, but good lord, the service is not even thinly veiled as giving a damn. If fact, there may be some secret code (*wink *wink *nod *nod?) that I'm missing, because the service gets worse and worse the more I go. 

On my last trip, the waiter actually stood at the bar and watched TV during our entire visit. We could clearly see him from our table doing so. We flagged him down to order garlic knots and wine. He never came back to fill our water or wine glasses. Then, we had to flag him down to place our order. Afterwards, after sitting neglected for a ridiculous amount of time, we just went to the hostess desk to try and pay our bill. 

I really want to love this place, but it's not worth the time (or the effort) to eat here. So, who wants to make me garlic knots now?"
R8w6zNp8fWJOy09FYIqG9g,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,"Worst.pizza.ever. Think: soggy bread. 

Maybe their other dishes are better. I wanted to like this place so I hope I am right."
aWh9qrSxlVy0mm2TfStv6w,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"My girlfriend brought me here to celebrate my new job, and we just used yelp to find it. Couldn't have been happier. Everything was on point. We got the special tomato risotto and the sliced lamb loin for main course.. So awesome! All of our other dishes were perfect as well. Also we sat out on the patio at the perfect time to watch the sun set. 10/10 will return!"
P2K3vngCH_qgMr__lxag0Q,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I would definitely recommend eating there, I think its the perfect spot for drinks and appetizers or for a nice dinner.  We got a nice table outside, it was a bummer it was so windy so it got a little chilly, but they brought over a space heater.  The food was phenomenal and the portions were so much more than I would have expected!  We all ordered different things off the restaurant week menu and everyone loved it.  I had the burrata and proscuitto salad for a starter (so good!), the baked mezzi rigatoni (and yes the meatballs literally melt in your mouth!), and the gelato and strawberries for dessert.  We also all did the wine pairing, both the red and white were delicious then they brought out the champagne toast and the lemmoncello for the whole table!  It was my friends birthday so they added a candle with her dessert."
tsnR2_jz6vyr-OrztWE53g,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Went for the fire put experience. The food was very good but the service left something to be desired. Had to ask for menus, silverware, drinks, etc. 

The waiter made no effort to accommodate us with a small child ( I/e no one with a toddler should be expected to sit through a 3 hour dinner). We had to bring up food items we saw online, the waiter wasn't even going to offer them to us. It's very understandable to see why a restaurant of this caliber is offering so many deals on groupon,gilt, travelzoo. 

Again we enjoyed the food very much but probably won't go back based on service."
Ug9SYjE94FqTvGZmh21DfQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Service was good.
Food was definitely lacking. 
Garlic knots were served without a dipping / red sauce.
Pasta tasted like they went across the street to publix and bought a box of store brand and the sauce was extremely watery and bland .
I won't be back."
wrxRl6_3Swa8192wkSBadw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"I liked my meal here, fresh and tasty but nothing out of this world. The Angel hair with Bolognese sauce was good but a tad salty.  I enjoyed my meal but the service was a little off- the waiter was distracted and rushing about.   All in all,, I would recommend it for some nice Italian at decent prices but I've had better."
ZPvXMrjZee7R0TawCX3d9g,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Another hole in the wall type place! We found it on Creative Loafing (I think). Yummy Italian food, tucked away setting, always busy with people who look like they are enjoying their food and each other's company (groups of friends AND couples). I've never been here on a date but this is a smart date restaurant! Our waitress the first time was awesome. Authentically Italian, funny, great personality and talked to us. My favorite thing here: chicken pesto (from the make your own pasta option)! It is sooo good. Wine selection is not too pricey so you can enjoy a glass (or bottle) of red with dinner. Easy enough for a casual night out! In the summer time you can eat at one of the outdoor tables."
XZ6JlPZz6JG3BKgCwP1FAw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,3,"This place is located right across the church and has a very relaxed setting. 

The food is good but the staff isn't that attentive if you sit outside. 

I like the salad and add steak. Their pasta was way too salty when I had it. For my pasta fix I go to flavors of Rome."
PsV4f_mTPcmdl0cB9lvlVQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"I've been to Aragosta a few times over the past 3 years.  Everything was pretty tasty up until i went back for restaurant week in August 2015  (yes, took me a while to write this review)  Now I'm not sure if service and food were bad due to the nature of restaurant week, but after that experience i won't be going back. 

The restaurant week menu was a bit tricky, $38 for 3 course meal, which consisted of about 7items for that price,the rest of the items on the restaurant week menu were add-on's, meaning you had to pay extra $2-$15 for certain meal options on the same restaurant week menu.   Already not worth it. 

We got there @7pm and didn't leave until 10pm- that was for an appetizer, main course and dessert, it wasn't busy at all, the waitress didn't communicate very well with us, she would drop by pieces and random dishes as they became available, never asked if we liked the food, I had to tell her that my pasta was dry, and there wasn't enough sauce on it, it took her 20 minutes to acknowledge it and not do anything about it, by the time she offered me some more sauce i was no longer interested in the meal.  

BAD SERVICE, BAD COMMUNICATION.  3 HOURS FOR A 3 COURSE MEAL IS A JOKE.  Not to mention it took us forever to flag her down for a check.  WILL NOT BE RETURNING THERE

Restaurant is very outdated, various decor from room to room, drinks are overpriced"
3Fe2fiIlQ0aCA_7CSiPW_g,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,Happy to report this little Italian Cafe is still as charming and delicious as ever.  We recently just had dinner and the pasta was wonderful as well as the seafood. Always friendly service any time of day inside or out.
4_lc_o3utI9YXImUB_v5kA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Please keep in mind that we did not have a meal in the restaurant: we had their afternoon tea (tea, scones, finger sandwiches, etc.). Weekend outdoor reservations were VERY hard to get, so plan to book at least a month in advance if you're set on being outside. In fact, if it wasn't for how generally difficult the reservation process was, this would have been a 5-star review. The first reservation request message was not even returned, and I had to leave another a few days later.
Past that, ""Tea by the Sea"" was very relaxing and a total hit with the wife. Our server Will was an absolute professional of the highest caliber. 2.5 hrs of total relaxation."
mQUkcuZaBOfFViQxyt57xg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I went here with my sis, cousin and a friend, we went specifically for the lobster bake and s'mores. We had a few drinks, raw oysters and truffle fries. The drinks were ok. The truffle fries on the other hand were delicious I couldn't stop eating them... the best I've had so far. The lobster bake and s'mores were also great. The ambiance outside and the entire setup with the fire pit tables was a great experience. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the host was a little rude at the end of our meal. You are limited to 2 hours. I guess we were relaxing and enjoying ourselves too much because he came to our table and basically told us he needed the table. Which was fine because our time was up. It just felt like he was rushing us. We didn't even get to pay for our meal at the table. He rushed us and then forgot to tell valet that my cousin was ready for her car. I think we waited like 20 mins or more just to get the car from valet."
oAgi5CHofz-bTugLNZN6YA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Ordered off Uber eats. I live nearby but the food was cold. Garlic knots didn't come with any sauce and were hard and stale. Pizza wasn't good- hard to mess up a margarita pizza. We ordered 2'cupcakes and they never came with the order, and nobody let us know. There are a ton of good pizza places in Atlanta, this is definitely not one of them."
ZCLh3VDuefbuOCvhc6fi8A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"We came here after exploring the North End to get some drinks and appetizers. Unfortunately the patio was closed but the host sat us by a window with an ocean view so that was nice. 

We got the salsiccia flatbread, clam chowder, D bolo, truffle fries, and lobster risotto. Everything was pretty good but I thought the D bolo and risotto were a little bit too salty. The D bolo was a gnocchi dish with veal cheek, oxtail ragu, basil and ricotta. It reminded me of a grown up version of Chef Boyardee. The risotto came in a little iron ramekin. It had more of a cheesy rice texture instead of the creamy smooth texture that's synonymous with risotto. I also did not see or taste any lobster in it so that was pretty disappointing (I also shared the dish with a couple other people so maybe that's why I didn't get any lobster). The clam chowder had a strong bacon flavor but it was pretty good. I actually really liked the flatbread. It came with sausage, broccoli rabe, fennel and ricotta. Some places tend to overcook flatbreads but it came out perfect in my opinion.

We got the tiramisu for dessert and it was amazing. It came with fresh berries and dolce de leche gelato. I'm not sure if the gelato is made in house but it was to die for. 

As for drinks, the whole menu looked pretty good. I got the white peach sangria and it was ok. It tasted like fruit juice. Not the best I've ever had. The other drinks on the menu looked pretty good though.

I really liked the ambience of this place. The hotel it's in is really nice. I'd recommend Aragosta for a nice date night."
wvCUz09fjAAyNacRPUx6Hg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"My boyfriend and I visited Aragosta on Friday, May 20th in anticipation of some great oysters in a new restaurant. Instead, we encountered poor service, disorganization, warm oysters and a cold atmosphere.

After going up to the bar twice to request water and menus for our table, we were told by our server that they did not have oysters even though the website claims ""Every Friday is Ostrica Friday this spring!"" We asked what was being offered in place of the oyster special and the server proceeded to get angry, raise his voice and then blame it on the chef. The server finally asked the manager to come over to our table.
 
We asked the manager the same question and instead of acknowledging that there was an issue, he seemed completely distracted and unapologetic for the confusion. We were then served two rounds of six mediocre oysters. The manager never returned to see how his patrons were faring after the miscommunication. The manager never offered to make amends or account for the poor service. 

To further our disappointment, we were given another party's tab and had to invade a private party downstairs to go to the restroom.

I even attempted to email the restaurant and the manager directly to offer my feedback. No response.
 
None of the above made for a pleasant dining experience.

Aragosta needs some major work on all fronts from the management to the staff to the food.

We won't be returning."
0MDsqik32Yoirsi84qNOug,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Its easy to put fancy ingredients together and put up a novel, if indifferent product; but a simple salad with chicken breast? It takes a perfectionist to make it shine. Chef Antonio did it. Everything perfectly balanced, along with a glass of prosecco(the only prosecco on the menu, and justly so). On a sunny day,  the piano playing, among the trees of Winter Park, you can be wistful about Roma, but not miss it too much."
etouzESIYezDqzHBz2ErMA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"We made reservations for Aragosta via OpenTable and saw that there were plenty of openings for a Friday night. We got there a few minutes early, and were taken to our table - probably the worst table in the restaurant. We had no view of the ""open kitchen"" and certainly no view of the waterfront - which was the only reason we picked this restaurant to begin with. We asked the hostess for a better table (as most of the restaurant was indeed empty) and were told that the rest of the tables were reserved by other guests. We explained that we thought that was the point of getting a reservation so that we could be one of those other lucky group of guests, but were again turned down. 

This initial attitude spoiled the rest of the dinner. The food was OK (we had the Gnocchi / Lamb and Seared Tuna) but certainly wasn't any better than another restaurant on the waterfront where we could have perhaps had an actual waterfront view.

By the way - the prime real estate tables we were denied in the beginning never filled throughout the course of our dinner and remained empty after we left."
xCATJXeoHw1QfV_F9pUJ5w,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. The Rigatoni and the Lobster Tagliatelle were excellent. Yum - Wellfleet oysters! Fantastic little patio view. Our server was very professional (though I kind of wanted to shake him a little). Must try fire pit reservation next time - I heard you need to reserve close to two weeks in advance! 

The online menu may not be the most updated menu; so prepare yourself and be ready to choose another item."
wapFwIHN5jD1qzIWSRgn9A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"The drinks were inventive and tasty, and they were made to have outside on the patio on a sunny day! The ahi tuna flatbread made for a great lunch...loved the fresh arugula."
KqPlfSElPyxfHk8DF34xiQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Just okay - not bad, not good. We had a Gilt certificate for a s'mores platter and 2 drinks outside on the patio while in town for a visit. 

While there, we ordered dinner - steak entree, burrata salad, tuna tataki - all were good, but considerably expensive. The food wasn't bad. It was decent...but we don't go back to restaurants for ""decent"" food, especially when the cheapest entree is $24.

The really annoying part was that our fire pit table kept going out every couple minutes. At first, the waiters would re-light it for us if they came by, but we got tired of waiting (and getting cold) every time so we figured the controls out and ended up having to re light it about 30+ times ourselves throughout our meal (not exaggerating). 

All said, it was a $120 bill when you include the gilt certificate...and I didn't even order a full entree. Just felt steep for the experience we had to be honest. Again, not bad, but not great especially considering the price. With no ""special"" items in the s'mores platter made in-house (it was just pre-made items that they took out of packaging) and a fire pit that didn't work, it didn't really make for an experience I would repeat.

~$120 included:
Glass of cabernet
Pint of Sam Adams
Macallan 12
Ribeye Steak Entree
Tuna Tataki small plate
Burrata salad small plate
S'mores platter (pictured) - (2) Reese's cups, Hershey bar, (5) marshmallows, (8) graham cracker squares, raspberries and blackberries

In addition...With the certificate, it instructed me to call to make a reservation. In the days leading up to our trip, I tried to call 2 days at different times throughout the day and never got through to anyone. I even left a voicemail that was never returned...I finally went on the website for the hotel it's attached to and called the number there and was patched through to someone at the restaurant."
3f_DETzPdJHs29uGOeWuNQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I was disappointed. I bought a Gilt City for making your own s'mores, but when we arrived they told us we could sit outside but that most people that came that day felt it was too cold. They had heat lamps, but did not bother to have them on, which forced us to sit inside. The s'mores were yummy, but I really did not get the Gilt City experience the restaurant offered. It would have been nice if they called us to let us know of their weather situation."
CdXIny0wAL1Xaxa09M3JHQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I love this spot for brunch. I also love that they are pet friendly - and allow pets on their patio in a designated area. My husband and I have been here a couple times for brunch and brought our dog Howie. The service is wonderful. They even give howie his own water bowl :) the coffee is good and comes with complimentary scones with butter, so good. If you get a cappuccino it comes with a couple cookies. They definitely know how to do the 'small touches' here, that often make all the difference. The food is awesome - good portions and amazing presentation. My husband loves the coast guard omelette that has lobster in it. They have a yummy blueberry French toast which my Dad got on Father's Day and loved. I got a burger once and it was so good. I also tried a special that came with an egg white frittata, acai smoothie, fresh fruit, and wheat grass shot. It was almost too beautiful to eat - but I did and it was great. Overall, highly recommend this place for a weekend brunch by the water!"
TXecQvGHHdxukl5l45jtzw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"What a great experience!! We sat in the lobby area for live jazz.  The music was wonderful and atmosphere was cozy and intimate!  We had Aldo as a waiter, he was fabulous! Will request him when we return for an evening by the fire!  He suggested a great variety of cheeses for the cheese plate we ordered. Everything was perfect and food was delicious. Couldn't have asked for a better evening. Can't wait to go back!!"
e8Sa7unYrz0nFtqtPv2-OA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"4 stars for a solid Italian spot on North Park Ave.

I went to dinner at Al Bacio as part of a group the other night for Yelp Restaurant Week (yay 30% off!). We arrived at the venue, which is located in a business complex, around 6:30. While we had a reservation for 12, we had no problem getting in and having a nice table set up for us.

We took our seats and the friendly waiter brought us menus and the drink list. The food and drink here is really well-priced (I think the most expensive dish was $24). More specifically, Al Bacio sells all of it's wine either by the bottle or for just $6 a glass, so I ordered a Pinot Grigio to start. It was a solid wine, but the small amount made me wish I had ordered a bottle (which I think was something like $20).

After looking through the menu and trying a complimentary bread starter that was crunchy and tasty, I put in an order for the snapper with a salad as my side. While all our food didn't quite come out at the same time, the timing was ok. The salad was good and the snapper was fairly solid. It came with a nice sauce on top that I liked, but a few others commented was a bit salty.

Overall, Al Bacio is a nice little Italian spot with good service and solid food and drink for the price. If you are looking to grab a bite of Italian, Al Bacio is worth checking out."
NA7BLY6eYQAnckh1kL-DlQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"Came for a visit and sat at the bar. I had never even heard of this place before but came on a friends recommendation. I was in for quite a treat when I arrive as Tyson Beckford and Andy Buckley (from The Office) were also both sitting at the bar. Quite the star studded evening.

Aside from that the bartender Joe was fantastic, he really knows how to make a good drink. I ordered the burger and it was also really good. I saw that they had a small patio that was equipped with fire pits. Seems like it would be the perfect stop for a romantic evening."

Generous portions, great coffee and a few surprise authentic Italian dishes will make you return again and again. This is where real Winter Park locals go for their morning coffee too. Don't forget to dip your biscotti in your capuccino's."
4o5sHZY3VfU_o6NztSQnHw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,Pathetic! On a casual Sunday tried to have a brunch. Place was pretty much empty and a disappearing host informed us that there is a 30 min wait??? Are you kidding me? Considering the fact there are a Hundred good restaurants nearby these guys obviously don't care whether they get any business or not. Let's hope someone at Marriott corporate reads and makes a note of this !
tK63Vk1VwQhZNjAqlg6bgQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Server was very nice and friendly.  Great outdoor seating.  Garlic knots were fresh and so were the other appetizer yeast rolls.  We also got the Arugula and Proscuitto - very good.  I was looking forward the main course based on the appetizers.   However, I was really dissappointed in the Chicken Francese.  The sauce was terribly bland, no lemon, no spices.  I ate half, but for their signature dish it didn't cut it by a long shot.  My wife got he chicken Parmesan and it was pretty much standard stuff.  Nothing like ""wow, this is great.""  It's hard to find good Italian in this city, coming from upstate NY.  But bottom line is this is average Italian, maybe slightly above."
xlXN7SNHkNLVDHrJ9ueUcw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Pasta Vino is a relatively expensive restaurant. So, it's reasonable to expect a higher standard here than at, say, a fast food place.

Positives:
1. Despite the fact that the individual with our party responsible for making reservations had not done so, they squeezed in our party of six fairly quickly.

Negatives:
1. If you, a relative, or a friend, must use a wheelchair, skip Pasta Vino. This is one of those restaurants with a twee demi-wall near the door - the sort that is nearly, if not actually, impossible to get a wheelchair around. The tables are packed in so tight that I could barely walk between them to reach the restroom. The dining area and the hall with the restrooms is separated by a decorative bead curtain that is, apparently, metal. I can't imagine how anyone in a wheelchair could possibly use the restroom.

2. Most meals are a stand alone entree with no vegetable or salad on the side. Complimentary bread is served, but who wants to fill up on carb-packed bread while waiting for a meal of carb-packed pasta? No one, that's who. Meanwhile, fricking CiCi's has a salad bar at no extra charge with their ""pizza"" buffet. For heaven's sake Pasta Vino, man cannot live by bread alone: throw some lettuce, broccoli, and grape tomatoes in a bowl and include salad with meals as a standard side dish.

3.Only alcoholic drinks are refilled. Two of our party ordered water, two soda, and two alcohol. Despite requests, only people drinking alcohol received refills/additional beverages during our meal. Both water drinkers and one soda drinker ran completely out of beverage before our meals arrived. The last time the waiter came to the table, we AGAIN asked the waiter to refill our water/soda. He nodded in the affirmative and asked ""is everything okay?"" One of the alcohol drinkers boomed ""everything is fantastic!"" Maybe the waiter thought that meant we didn't need beverages with our meal after all? We were so thirsty we could not even fairly judge the food. Was it tasty? I was too thirsty to tell."
VkQIl_iBXEYBMcvdBZ37ew,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"I have been coming to Pasta Vino since I was a kid, and hands-down, this place has the  best garlic knots not only in Atlanta, but everywhere. -And I've tried them all.

It's a great restaurant for smaller families and groups, though they can accommodate larger sizes. The service is friendly; I've strucken-up conversation with my waiters many times. -Plus the food is delicious. (fresh and hot). 
You definitely won't be leaving hungary!

It's recommended to call ahead, though, dinner on Friday nights can be crowded, Lunch is more mellow."

Skilled, attentive service, easy party planning beforehand, tasty food (we had 3 stations - pasta, raw bar & guac and chips and heavy passed appetizers) and specialty wines and alcohols per our request!

The food was good but teeny portions.  Six of us got the clambake special.  It was supposed to be a clambake for two but i really think they took a clambake for one and added an extra piece of cornbread.  One lobster, a handful of mussels and clams, half an ear of corn, and little pieces of chorizo.  Was very tasty but, um, not even a whole ear or corn to be divided among two?  So while everything was delicious, I think a clambake for two has to include enough food for two.  Some of my friends got other food and that was tasty and well portioned.  The french fries were very good."

oFNgFZiUIX9qsWbL_izlhQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"The location and the patio seating is fantastic, but the food was a little disappointing. But not unexpected since it's a hotel restaurant. The starters of the crab cake bites and grilled garlic shrimp was good. The lobster cavatappi was too oily, lacked lobster and wasn't worth the $14 price tag. We had the lobster risotto which was just ok. Other places were a lot better. The sea scallops was just okay. Nothing to rave about. The steak frites were a big let down as the four pieces were huge 2 inches cuts that is atypical for this dish. And that it was not medium rare at all. Should have said something but was enjoying a night out with friends. The only saving grace was the truffle French fries. 

Definitely won't be back to eat unless it's drinks on the patio. Been here to do the smores over he fire out and afternoon tea. Separate occasions and a while back. 

Tip: if u valet your car expect a 20 min wait. It wasn't cool waiting around and looking at the cars they brought over that wasn't yours...."
Rl5h__ngF11Uwnz-bKiTqQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"I would highly recommend the muscles in the white wine sauce. It was full of flavor, tons of garlic, herbs, tomatoes, and is a hearty appetizer. The free garlic bread was served warm but you have to pay for dipping sauce. The bread was good only with the marinara. 

Other than that, I wouldn't recommend anything else here. The wild mushroom soup was a huge mistake. I took a few spoon full scoops and sent it back. It was bitter and didn't look appetizing at all. The spaghetti with meatballs was basic and nothing special. The meatball while it was big, it was mushy and was flavorless. It was well portioned, because my friend an I split the entree. 

The server is horrible. He was short with us, and we had to ask a few time for water, cheese and oil because he kept forgetting."

When you walk in the front door you are met with a greeting and a view of their gourmet pastries you need a napkin so you won't drool on yourself.

zGWg0bNOKvnC0qFGPj_u0g,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"They do not take reservations for their outdoor seating, which stinks.

It is such a great view and I planned to eat at their restaurant just for that - even with the 'mehhh' reviews on their food.

Booked on OpenTable for 10 people. Requested outdoor seating. Didn't realize it is 'first come first serve' until the day of my dinner party. Canceled it. I want the terrace.

I used to go when this was Sensing for the view and you could reserve patio space."
_KtpE0aG9vKignzrMW6KJQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Think this place deserves more than the overall rating of 3.5 stars. Firstly, the service was attentive. Once we sat, we were served their warm house-made garlic bread. Then there was the house-made potato chips for you. The clam pasta I ordered came in a fragrant sauce, that was super with the garlic bread. Will try others next time."
Is5nPXgA1E8ZrgZNQVAFpQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"I could comment about the terrible service (like everyone else here does) or their gorgeous patio dining but what I'm really on here for is to tell you about their rodent problem. 

While outside on said pretty patio, drinking a so-so cocktail, I heard a rustle by my feet. There, in the decorative shrubbery by my table, was a wee mouse. Minutes later I observed 2 large rats scurry by. Yes it's an outdoor dining area, but for that many rodents to be out and about while people are present is concerning."
PN0aRZJKI1n9fupJijXHKQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"I visited this restaurant for the second time recently, the first time I went they were relatively new and it was average, went back after they had redone the place, thought I would give it another try and man what an overpriced disappointment. Cool atmosphere, nice location and good service but if your going to have an Italian restaurant in the north end of Boston, at least know what you're doing with some of the italian staples.
If you do decide to check it out, sit outside, have a cocktail and some of that crusty bread, the rest of the menu is extremely overpriced for such small portions; for example the beet salad aka the beet down salad, its literally a scoop of goat cheese, 4 beet slices and a couple pieces of arugula scattered on top with a drizzle of dressing, some salad. I have had several items on the menu, look out for the pappardelle bolognese, very different presentation then any bolognese I've ever had but the sauce tasted like bad meat, very poor. Don't even get me started on that meat and cheese board with meats that I haven't seen since 4th grade. They should just throw the olive loaf on there. The majority of the items on the menu are extremely deceiving descriptions of what you are anticipating on getting. Never again!!"
nXQtWLSgRfb7nJ1Vf22h9g,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Chose this place after searching for Italian restaurants in Atlanta on Mother's Day. It wasn't busy which was surprising since it was a holiday.  We probably should have taken that as a sign.  Pasta vino was very disappointing.  First sat us next to the bathroom which had chains hanging from the door way which was extremely annoying. Very small and stuffy inside. 

The food was very disappointing.  The chicken florentine had no flavor, the sauce was watery, and the chicken was soggy.  Not good.  Hubby had chicken parm.  The chicken was not fried and the sauce was not good.  Not Italian portions either.  The complimentary bread was good after we asked for fresh bread since the first basket was stale.. Can't complain about free bread though. 

Server did not even check to see if we were satisfied.  Came to the table twice throughout the night and it was not even busy.  

Overall, disappointed. Will not be back."

e8RyIsdSyFbm5JsuYsF1GA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"I am loathe to talk about what good, authentic Italian food this little eatery serves.  Too many people might show up and my husband and I could possibly never get a table again.  We stopped in for lunch after an appointment at Bangz, hoping to grab a quick bite.  I have to be brutally honest here and say that we almost made a u-turn.  The pastry display was less than half full and there were only four other people in the place, save for the employees.  It seemed a little shabby, frankly speaking.  A caveat here is that we are Miamians and accustomed to the glitz of So. Beach, Coral Gables, etc.  That being said, we seated ourselves at a little table and began our journey into the land of deliciousness.  I ordered the tuna Azzuro panini.  The ciabatta was fresh and soft, EVOO dressed the imported Italian tuna with a splash of balsamic, a small sliver of fresh mozzarella and another of avocado.  Wonderful in its simplicity.  Hubby, being a cheeky fellow, and counting on his Italian roots to garner favor with a fellow Italian, asked for clams and linguine, though it was not yet the dinner hour.  The chef/owner was very gracious and made it for him.  I had my fork in it before it hit the table!  The pasta was al dente, the clams were fresh and, though it was a garlicky white sauce, there were also some strips of fresh tomato.  I dreamed about it last night...but, I digress.  Accompanying my panini were waffle-cut sweet potatoes as soft as a pillow, sans grease.  Also, a small side salad with a light dressing.  Perfetto.  On a roll, we couldn't stop eating and ordered desserts and an espresso each.  Though the desserts..an orange tart and a berry/custard puff pastry..were good, we had already eaten far too much.  Now, we cannot wait to return for dinner.  Meanwhile, we're taking our NY relatives there for lunch next week.  To sum it up, I would give Al Bacio a full four stars for the food and three stars for ambience.  Bravo!"
XWRTGFtC7WzfG7e6pW4HYw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"I'm hesitant to post my review because I fear everyone will flock to this place and I won't be able to find a cozy table like I have in the past.. However, this restaurant cannot go without praises. ""Neighborhood gem"" doesn't come close! I've had so many fabulous dinners there I don't know where to begin. The shrimp and grits is the best ANYWHERE, hands down. My daughter had their apple and goat cheese ravioli this evening and said it was divine! She had the gnocchi last week and said it was the best ever (and that woman is very picky about gnocchi!) I had chicken Marsala and it was perfectly cooked. A glass of House-made Sangria, great service, and outdoor seating made for a perfect evening."
TX7voLdPmZ7HMIwIGUOE-Q,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"I've been coming here for years. In fact, this place has been around since I was a little girl, before the internet was huge, and has seen many shops come and go in the little strip mall. I'm told the original owners became too old to care properly for the restaurant anymore, so it's been turned over to a family friend of theirs (and I believe the name/decor changed along with it while the menu didn't budge much). I had the chance to go back last night for a post-birthday dinner with family, and was curious to see if this place that gave me my first taste of mussels was just as good as my tastebuds remembered it.

For such a tiny place and with a Cheyenne Grill next door, by 7pm it was slammed. Not a table remained unfilled, and everyone from elderly couples to families with small children piled into the seats. For all the people inside this small space, it wasn't too loud. My hard of hearing grandfather made out fairly well all things considered, which is rare for him in a restaurant. It seemed like a great place for kids and dates alike, just as I remembered.

The menu had changed a little, though the main feature was still pasta and seafood. I chose the goat cheese and apple ravioli and we all split an order of the fried zucchini and a ceasar salad. The salad was crispy with fresh lettuce and not drowning in dressing while the zucchini was mostly crunchy (though admittedly the bottom of the pile became a little soggy from the juices in the zucchini - still tasted great though!). Fresh rolls were brought out every time we emptied the baskets, and every bite was warm and delicious. It took a while for our main meal to come out, but considering we'd just stuffed our faces on bread and salad, it made sense to space it out. People who order just entrees will get them much quicker. I know dine-and-dash is a big thing in American culture, which makes me wonder how people deal with travel to Europe...

Anyway, my goat cheese and apple ravioli was delicious! The sauce was apple pureed with what seemed like a light cream and the ravioli was filled with cheese. Overflowing, even. The salty and the sweet mixed very well together, and I was happy with my choice. Everyone else seemed to greatly enjoy their meals as well; in fact, we all had clean plates at the end of dinner which is extremely uncommon in my family. Good food = clean plate = full, happy bellies? Imagine that.

As long as you're okay with European time, you'll be just fine here. The staff may be ""slow"", but this is a sit-down restaurant. If you're that eager to be in and out of a place, I'm pretty sure Pizza Hut delivers still... ;) The staff is super friendly and enjoys a good joke with the table. They make you feel like it's a family affair, your mother cooking away in the kitchen at a pace all her own while other family members entertain you. It was very classic Italian-style (if you've ever been to Italy, you'll know what I mean).

I think is a wonderful place to scope out if you haven't yet. It's a little tucked away and you might not see it right away, but it's well worth hunting it down. Considering how long it's been around and how many patrons (my grandparents included) are regulars, it's clearly worthy of trying at least once!"
DFX5Q0-h97mhy6KC6GVwpw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Pasta Vino has been my neighborhood favorite for years. The food, atmosphere, and service are hard to beat for the price and convenience.

In addition to the great Italian food, the outdoor seating makes it one of the most popular dinner spots during the summer in Atlanta."
eiDOIEH8UxfMdiUeuehAew,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I eat at Aragosta quite frequently and love the food and the ambiance, so it seemed only logical to celebrate my birthday - a BIG one - there as well. I am so glad I did! The entire evening was flawless from end to end. 

We started with cocktails in the hotel lobby, with everyone comfortably arrayed on plush sofas and armchairs around several small tables. No big crowds, no noise (even though there was a big wedding reception going on downstairs there was virtually no spillover), plus plenty of space and room for conversation. Our server was wonderful, very personable and attentive, and the wines-by-the-glass were interesting and varied. We had several plates of appetizers delivered to us out there (thanks, Chef Daniels!), including some delicious meatballs and flatbreads that were promptly devoured by my guests. A perfect starter for the evening. I particularly liked that, even though our dinner reservation was for 7:30 and several people arrived late, which extended the cocktail hour, no one rushed us. They told us to take as much time as we needed, which was handy because, dammit, I had presents to open!

When we finally entered the dining room, I found that they had helped my friend set up the table in advance (she brought several beautiful flower arrangements and they were nicely set out along the table). The atmosphere was perfect. I loved the semi-private seating area - it was a long table that accommodated everyone, set apart from the rest of the dining room by a set of sheer curtains. This made it easy to maneuver from seat to seat, so I could visit with all of my guests, without making anyone feel cramped or cut off from the lovely view or the action in the dining room.

The food was fabulous, as always. I've sampled a number of dishes there, including the bolognese, the sole, and a pork tenderloin special they made once that was out of this world, but for my birthday dinner I decided to go with the steak. It was delicious, and perfectly cooked. Once again, the service was superb - all of the dishes came out on time, the pacing was perfect from appetizer through dessert & coffee (they made me a special chocolate torte thingie with a candle), and, once again, no one felt rushed or pressured to wrap up. My friends raved about their meals as well (and this is a picky bunch). 

It just seemed, overall, that everyone at the restaurant - from the hostess to the waitstaff and particularly the folks in the kitchen - knew it was a special night for me and they all worked together to ensure it stayed that way. I could not have been happier with how my evening went and will most definitely be back."

9hvPt3HErFn_mMeJNMN_LA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,"If it weren't for the outdoor dining, convenient location and complete dearth of remotely decent (non-chain) Italian restaurants in Atlanta/Buckhead, this restaurant would cease to exist. If there was ever a case-study to prove that the lack of competition disadvantages the customer, here it is!  Ever since Nico sold out, this restaurant has underwhelmed on quality and service and overwhelmed on cost (for what you get)...when your server brings your bill, they should go ahead and complete the mugging experience by dropping the tab while wearing a ski mask.  This restaurant should be endorsed by the Democratic party because it clearly operates under a premise that their clientele has entirely too much disposable income and they are here to reconcile that.  The house wines are as mediocre as house wine gets except they are often warm and/or stale and they charge $8 a glass. The Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio, for example, goes for $15 a glass while you can easily buy a bottle for under $20 from numerous retailers which begs the question of what their corkage fee is???  
Service is commensurate with hostagesque patrons.  Servers wait on an assortment of tables inside and outside on the patio which assures a complete lack of continuity but still doesn't explain where they can disappear to for 15-20 minutes at a time.  My guess is they are in a back room laughing their a$$e$ off that the patrons continue to come back...perhaps they should consider rebranding the restaurant as Pasta Stockholm Syndrome.  If my kids weren't complete pasta junkies, I would almost certainly stop touching the hot stove...shame on me.  
I think if you stay in the shallow end, with the pizzas and spaghettis, you are ""ok"" but once you venture up the ""quality"" scale you are in for a woeful disappointment unless your developed your Italian tastes at the Pasta Barn or under the masterful offerings of Chef Boyardee."
EfO6utXHfqYYio5tTpv5fw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"This review is for the Afternoon Tea on weekends. I've done this twice now and had a great time both times. 

ADVICE: Make a Reservation! Though it doesn't say this anywhere, and you can still enjoy the food/tea, they want you to make a reservation because apparently it takes an hour to put everything together for this tea. Noted for next time.

We were told it was going to be about 45 minutes to prepare the spread so we agreed and sat against the windows. The view of the harbor is nice. We got to see the Coast Guard ships and people watch the guests arriving via water taxi. The room was chilly (though I'm a naturally cold person so take that for what it's worth) and by the end of the hour, I was cold and hungry and entering into child mode. Luckily our food came out shortly after and I forgot about my internal struggle to not start acting like a child because everything was SO GOOD! 

I ordered the White Orchard tea which is a peach and melon flavored drink. Wow. Wow wow wow it was awesome!

You get two bites of each item and in total there were 2 pairs of scones, 4 pairs of tea sandwiches, and 3 pairs of desserts. This may not seem like a lot but I was hungry when it came out and I had to pace myself after sampling 3 or 4 of the items. My suggestion, eat all the sandwiches and take home whatever scones and desserts you can't finish. The cream that comes with the scones is amazing. They gave us some to go with our scones and I've been putting it on everything! The vanilla lavender scones are out of this world. Other highlights are the Prosciutto di Parma and brie with fig jam toasts, the cucumber tartine which are very refreshing, and the savory chicken bites. We had some substitutions that weren't listed like a lobster roll (Maine Style) instead of the egg salad sandwich and these cider cinnamon sugar ""donuts"" which reminded me more of a zeppole than a donut. Amazing though.

Overall, the food was great and the tea was amazing. Come hungry because it's filling despite looking like a small amount (it's not) and make a reservation so you don't have to wait as long as we did!

We'll definitely be back again. Maybe in a warmer month to better enjoy the outdoor area."

E7QDl3g8iKeziOly7E4GiA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I finally made it to Aragosta and I was more than pleased with the results.  During my first visit my girlfriend and I tried the Goat Cheese Rigatoni for an appetizer, the Seared Tuna and the Lobster Fra Diavlo for entrees.  The Goat Cheese Rigatoni was the most amazing appetizer I have ever had in Boston.  The rigatoni is stuffed with goat cheese and then topped with more goat cheese and truffle oil.  I wanted to cancel my entree and order more it was that good.  My girlfriend had the Seared Tuna and it was fresh and cooked exactly the right way.  I had the Lobster Fra Diavlo and was amazed at how much lobster it had.  Usually restaurants charge a ton of money and barely give you any lobster......not at Aragosta.  I had a whole lobster on top, cracked open for easier access with additional lobster meat piled on top of the pasta.  The sauce was perfect and had just the right amount of kick to it.

I went back about a week later for Fathers Day and again had the Goat Cheese appetizer which was again the most amazing thing ever.  I had talked so much to my family about how great the Lobster Fra Diavlo was that all four of us got it.  It was just as amazing as the first time I tried it however there was far less lobster meat on it this time around.  The service for both visits were great, I know there are some reviews of poor service on here but I experienced nothing but prompt, friendly and perfect service.  I believe we had a waiter named Aldo for our Fathers Day visit and he was great, very friendly and a very good sense of humor with us.

I'll absolutely be back and will recommend this restaurant to anyone."
1OqV3gS5_GYLdJHpRfYklQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Awful awful service!!! I decided to have my 30th bday here with family and friends driving 5+ hours into Boston to celebrate with me.  The hostess was very pleasant and very accommodating that we asked to move from the terrace to inside due to most of my party becoming cold.  She sat us in a private ""room"" with curtains... Very nice.. And much better than the terrace. Only downfall... Barely any lighting! We asked our server if he could turn the lights up a bit and he replied that they are on a timer of some sort and he doesn't think so.  Okay, no big deal we can eat in the dark! I was surrounded by great company so this was a small miss.  Next we waited for our waiter... Ordered our drinks and then waited some more... The drinks seemed to lack alcohol, so much that my father had to ask for more whiskey in his ""whiskey smash"" drink because it looked like pure ice water.  After waiting again for our waiter we put in our app order.  Cheese and meat tray... After again, another 15 mins to get that it was subpar.  Not awful, but not great. We ordered our entrees, they came out quicker than the meat and cheese tray.  The gnocchi was fabulous, the sausage and peppers excellent, other than that disappointments all around. My mother ordered lobster risotto   And couldn't eat it because it was too fishy. She didn't want to complain, because she felt bad, so I did it for her and our waiter was kind enough to remove it from our bill.  Although he was very kind, had he checked in on us more than twice during a 3 hour meal we would have spent more money on drinks and stayed later for dessert.  We ordered one round of drinks and wanted another but he never came back to ask! We had empty water glasses for about 20 mins.  We were so thirsty my boyfriend was seconds away from walking up to the bar with all our glasses to ask for water.  For an almost $350 dinner I would expect much better service and much better food.

I have recently gone to Aragosta with our guest visiting from Chicago. First things first - the view itself is amazing, There is outside seating, absolutely stunning view. We started with cocktails - i ordered a Nantucket Blueberry lemonade and loved it, my guest was also pleased with her cocktail. For food (as you see from my previous reviews) I am vegetarian and I was pleasantly surpised. My gnocci with mushrooms and peas were excellent. The rest of my party ordered oysters, lobster chowder and tuna. The star of the evening was a risotto served with foie gras and (wait for it!) black truffles from Burgundy. The chef himself (i think the name is Graham) came by our table and shaved the truffles on top of our friends plate. I could smell it across the room - amazing! The desert was also a big hit - I oredered creme brulee. The staff was fast and very pleasant. Our waiter was wonderful - he didnt push anything but was very knowledgable, friendly and funny. The bread with olive oil was great. One tip - you have to check out the bathroom downstairs."

They ordered interesting omelets but I saw the pasta lunch special in a bottom corner of the menu and our waiter told me the pasta was house made. The chef owner came out to visit us and asked what he could make for me. We settled on pappardelle with mushrooms and artichokes with arugula on top. The girls heard this and changed their orders to different individually made pasta dishes. Our dishes were fresh and delicious - we couldn't have been happier with our meals, the friendly staff or the outside table where we watched the parade of passers by at leisure. Highly recommended."

Date night last night, and we had thought about Cinebistro (that J. Edgar Hoover movie looks good!) but, alas, you have to be there 30 minutes before showtime to eat and we couldn't make it for the 8:30 show. Whatever to do?? After contemplating and dismissing a few options, we decided that champagne at home then a stroll across the Peachtree Battle piazza to Pasta Vino sounded great.

Ran into a girlfriend from high school, he knew one of the servers well, and we had another lovely meal. Calamari was spot-on, and the Chianti was nice. I went with the chicken Francese again; it was good, but not great. But that might have been because I've had chicken three out of my last four meals. . . The boy went with his favorite dish, veal parmigiana, and I have to say- it was delicious! Between our meals at Nino's and PV, I am sold on this dish,which isn't something I would usually order. Pasta Vino's version is lightly breaded, with a very tasty marinara. Yum. He won this round for sure!

Lots of regular patrons and I am beginning to be one of them.  I really like this place :)

The restaurant has a beautiful outdoors seating area with firepits. My friend and I shared a Gruyere Fondue and it was lovely. The fondue took some time to heat up over the firepit but it eventually got to a nice gooey consistency! After that, we finished off with an order of Deluxe S'mores which came along with bananas and reese peanut butter cups.

The service was *exceptionally* good. Everyone from the hostess to waiters were friendly and attentive. When our cheque had some issues, the manager thoroughly explained it without implying any blame on us.

I recommend sitting around the firepits with a bunch of friends to have a drink or light bites for a relaxing time!"

I ordered the Ciabattini omlette, and the ""seasonal vegetables"" were obviously from a bag of frozen mixed vegetables you can get from the freezer isle of your local grocery store (cauliflower, carrots, lima beans, in an omlette?) and it tasted like it. My party's dishes looked similar. The coffee was unremarkable, and the service was poor."

The service is great, the atmosphere is friendly and casual,  but the food? It could not be less authentic Italian cuisine, but even worse, it's bad food of any cuisine.
That a chicken breast, poorly breaded and burned, left the kitchen, is inexcusable. It should have been thrown in the trash. That it was placed on top of a mound of un-sauced, cold pasta is shocking.  The red sauce surrounding the chicken was flavorless and had an unappealing consistency. The mozzarella on top of the chicken was rubbery. Nothing about this dish exhibited any thought or care.
I do not know who is in charge of the kitchen but it is disgraceful that food so badly executed, of this poor quality is served. You would have to go out of your way to make food this unattractive. I cannot imagine that trained cooks would be satisfied with the product they serve to customers.
But the place has a loyal, enthusiastic following.
I emailed them about my disappointing experience and never heard back."

Upon arrival, four of our party met the other two in the party in the lobby. We are all of African American heritage with four masters degrees between us. Not loud or outrageous. Appropriately dressed for dinner in a fine dining establishment. Upon checking in with the hostess, we were greeted in a gruff manner with an immediate demand for the groupon. I thought maybe she was just having a bad day but after dinner we spoke with the two in our party who arrived early and learned that while waiting in the foyer for the rest is, they were approached by this same woman in a  rude way and were asked what they were doing there. Not, can I help you or are you meeting someone. ""What are you doing here?"" I have visited all kinds of establishments from neighborhood pizza shops to five star restaurants and have never witnessed this kind of treatment. Rest assured, I will not visit this establishment again."

My salad, with Mediterranean vegetables was really not tasty.  And I LOVE salads.  In fact, I can't figure out why it wasn't good. Other than the fact that the eggplant was not the freshest and the bleu cheese salad dressing was an odd addition.  The caprese panini wasn't bad, but it was cold?   The chicken salad sandwich was the best result of the bunch.   

Very cute location.  Nice touches inside.  Indoor and outdoor seating. Bar seating for 7.  Serving staff was very friendly.

REGobKkeacEUoubGNd_cLA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"Quick recommendation: get the gnocchi and the short rib smashed potatoes while sitting at the Chef's Counter with Donna. 

More details: I love food. I'm a bit of a food whore...in that, for the right dish, I might sell myself. And the gnocchi here is the right dish. This is by far the best gnocchi I've had in Boston (even beating Trattoria Toscana's): light but well packed, deliciously flavored, and generally perfect. My eating partner got the steak...which is served on a bed of short rib smashed potatoes. I almost stabbed him to get just a few bites of that. Not that my salmon on its own bet of buttery delicious smashed potatoes was a slouch, but if you eat red meat, GET THE SHORT RIBS SMASHED POTATOES. And the gnocchi. Oh god, and the cheese plate and the oysters were amazing too. 

We sat at the Chef's Counter and watched in amazement as Chef Donna somehow managed to keep the delicious food cooking while chatting with us and being incredibly lovely. Aldo was out server, and I have honestly never had someone pair my wines with a meal so well before. Uh-maze-ing all around.

I now dream of that gnocchi. I'm actually drooling just writing this review."
EB2EzknZl82Et73CffZIQg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Had a pre-arranged reservation where deposit was made and a preset menu chosen for a party of 22 all set up a month prior and we requested outdoor seating.  Was charged 500 for sitting/reserving the sidewalk section, no water view, had 1 server the entire night (nice lady) but that large of a party can't be served by one person. It took forever to get drink orders, apps and dinner.  The food was average at best, we ordered 6 bottles of wine (for 22 people) plus other cocktails and the total tab with tip ended up being $200/person.  

Very disappointed in the atmosphere, service and overall value."
wBDz_Aa-Y8EzP025tmLgkA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,This place is horrible!! I am a small person and I don't eat much but I was able to eat my whole cardboard dish. The pasta had no flavor and neither did the chicken. To add on the miserymisery the service was worth a crap. I had to chase her down for everything we needed. It took her 20 minutes to bring me out a glass of sprite. I am pretty sure Olive Garden would have been better than this place!!
Xmoa565Rrw3Jee3Gw-Knmw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"One star - and that's taking into account the fact that our food was actually quite good.  The lobster crostini app was fresh and certainly didn't skimp on the lobster.  Carbonara main course was not too heavy, and the pasta was of good quality.

But when you leave the restaurant feeling as though you would have been more satisfied had you just spent the night sitting on the curb outside, there's an issue (we actually got a taste of this at the end of the night).  

While our server at first appeared to be a functional, responsive adult, her actions quickly brought this assumption into serious question.   Finding us a drink menu? 10 minutes. Asking whether we'd actually like to order something off said menu? Another 15 mintues. (For context, this was a saturday night, but restaurant only 2/3 full). My fiance's wine miraculously braved the trip to our table without incident.  My beer unfortunately never made it... 

A bus boy actually then brought out our food in relatively short order.  However, by this point our server had apparently decided her job was done.  No further check-in's, no ""how is everything"", nothing.  Which is fine by us, until you need to pay the bill.  At this point the place starts to feel less like a restaurant and more like a prison.  And we needed to get out.  After another 15min with no sign of our server (kidnapped maybe?) we finally just gave our credit card to another staff member.

We'd driven and valet parked, so there was one final opportunity for Aragosta to add salt to the wound.  Thankfully, they didn't disappoint.  We were second in line behind another couples that was clearly as upset as we were.  So it seemed only right that after waiting 10min, they come back with the wrong car. Another 10min later (or a full 35min after we'd decided we were ready to pay and leave), our car arrives.  Escape at last..."
d-ktu-YdRZsasvrEcHcSdA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Wouldn't go out of your way to eat here.  Views are primarily of the Coast Guard ships, service is not great and prices are high. Our tab was $63 with tip ($55 without) for 1 glass of wine, 1 beer, a tomato balsamic appetizer (4 small tomato wedges covered in pesto and balsamic with thinly sliced red onions) and the garlic shrimp appetizer (5 pieces of shrimp).  Server also took my drink away before I had finished.  Felt like a bust that I had recommended this place for dinner.  Ok for drinks if you're in the area."
rjbX0uQTFiO8jUwT2c_C9w,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"What a disappointing trip this was tonight.  This was my 4th visit to pasta vino.  Each time the service has been tragically and painfully slow.  Other times it has been the wait for the food to come out.  Tonight it was the wait to be seated.  
We were told the wait would be around 25 minutes max and it ended up being an hour.  My boyfriend and I watched a few groups and couples be seated before us.  We tried to give the benefit of doubt for the first few (maybe they had reservations, maybe a large table was free but not a small)...however you can only make so many excuses.  The hostess never offered us drinks or garlic rolls which we noticed she did for other groups of older patrons (and this is not to suggest we are teenagers or something--we are late-20's, even though that shouldn't effect our service either way).  How frustrating.

The table we were seated at was a serious squeeze, behind a table of 4 children ages ~4-10 y/o seated at a separate table next to their parents.  Really, we were seated closer to these kids than their parents were. It was truly irritating. 

At no point did the hostess or waiter express any sense of apology for our wait, seating location...or anything.  In fact our waiter maybe said 4 words to us.

The only reason they get 2 stars is because the food is truly pretty good.  But good food after waiting an hour just to get seated?  Then, to be seated by irritating children not being supervised?  Let's just say, we won't be returning.

Save yourself the stress and don't go.  There are places with good food and good service...why go to a place with bad service?"
__VIB4HxXzBJOGOcT17qCA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"You can't beat the beautiful setting right on Boston Harbor right across from the Coast Guard Station.

1W-638y9XRxcrnRhrK0Z-Q,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I picked Aragosta purely because of the reported view and decided to ignore the bad reviews it got here on Yelp.  I had some out of town guests here in Boston and I wanted them to see the Harbor view.  While it ended up being a misty-rainy day, the view was great, esp. from the outdoor seating area.  I imagine during the summer this would be the perfect spot to have a drink and some apps.  

The food we ordered was very well done - I had the BLT breakfast and my friends all ordered the crepes.  The coffee was good and the OJ was freshly squeezed.  Everyone was very pleased with the meal and the atmosphere was great.  We had a relaxing 2 hour brunch on a Sunday and I am definitely recommending it others.  The service was good and the lobby a nice to hang while your party arrives.  I'm not sure about others bad experiences but I can't say anything but good things."
vQNh80jvXhZE1bW2j8yA2w,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"So I just moved practically next door to Pasta Vino (OK, to the Peachtree Battle Shopping Center) and have quickly become a new-again fan of longtime local fave Pasta Vino. Remembering the tasty dishes they served up to my family when I was young, I ventured back within a few days of my move, and quickly returned for follow up eats because it was even better than I remembered!! 

This is a place with all the Italian classics, plus very tasty pizza (served as whole pies or slices at all hours) and a nicely large menu with apps and salads plus a section where you can create your own pasta, in both entree and ""small plate"" portions. Me likey. 

My favorites . . . The calamari is a solid starter, just lightly battered with a really good marinara sauce. And almost all rings, which is my personal preference! A delicious tomato bisque, some of the best I've had around here in a very long time. If this is your kind of soup, definitely try theirs. Tasty Caesar salad, which is always something I lean towards when I'm dining Italian. 

The Chicken Francese is yummy, just lightly battered, and they're happy to let you substitute any noodle you prefer for the come-with (I like linguine best). On the pizza side, it's hard to go wrong, The white pizza is perfect, the margherita is light and tasty with just enough tomato and fresh basil, the prosciutto and arugula is one of my favorites as these are two of my most loved toppings, and the ""works"" is the classic choice with, well, everything on it; the crust is just thin enough and best of all, it's good when you get it but keeps well to be reheated and eaten a day or two later! 

Service is friendly and consistent (note: this is a ""neighborhood"" spot, not a fine-dining place, ie, the waiter's likely to ask if you want to try your wine but then incorrectly pour it in the glass of the person who sampled it, not the other person's glass first!) and prices are very reasonable. There can be a wait on Fridays and Saturdays, but things move fairly quickly. Take-out is always a good option. 

Ultimately, it's molto bene that I moved so close because now I know just where I can stroll across the Peachtree Battle piazza to get my Italian fix any time I need to!"
ndQSUhJdofCRsU8_Sy_K9Q,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Their fruit plate with yogurt comes with a TON of fruits and a wide variety  of them as well! It is a little pricey for breakfast but it's conveniently located at the hotel we were staying at so we couldn't complain. Since we're staying here for a couple more days I'm sure we will be back again. 

The honey that comes with the berry granola and yogurt was great by the way. It was so smooth and wasn't thick in consistency. It comes in a little cute jar :)"
#NAME?,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,I just wasted $55 at this restaurant. Upon entering we were ignored and then seated next to the bathroom even though there were other tables open. Service was terrible! Food mediocre. I had to send my pizza back as it was not hot. Waited so long for waiter to check in everyone else in my party was done before he even took pizza for reheat. Never asked if it was better afterward. Caesar salad had tasteless dressing and shaved cheese that was hard as a rock. My daughter got plain spaghetti and it was so under cooked I could barely cut it for her. I've heard of al'dente but come on! We won't be back.

P8KV8Az_WJcw-__ktkDIWQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Aragosta is a hotel restaurant and this is it's biggest shortfall.  The colors on the banquet are the same as a hotel room..I think I remember them being in the green/orange family.  The pictures on the wall are of the same color.  If you looked at them you would think
that you were in any average/standard hotel room.  I think this restaurant serves as a breakfast and lunch place also and that is how the service was.  Service was just ok.  

 I would recommend going and sitting at the chef's bar.  

Despite the lack of ambiance and service, the food was good.  We had the octopus salad and it was done nicely.   The gnocci and chicken  were done nicely and the bread served at the beginning was homemade.  

If you go  to Arogosta sit at the chef's bar by the open kitchen.  The chef was interesting to watch and you will be entertained  so you wont have to care that you can't find your server.  I'm being very genorous

I honestly had no idea that this place existed up until that point because it's at the south end of Park Ave, but I'm so very glad that we got trapped by the rain when we did because this place was phenomenal even though it was just cappucino and desserts but what really impressed me were the details, the cleanliness, and the friendliness. 
The little biscotti that comes with your coffee was amazing, seriously; it had a subtle orange flavor and bits of almonds, nice and crisp.

I ended up getting the chicken dish with lemon sauce and it was absolutely delicious I had no leftovers. They didn't have just regular sweet tea, however they did have sweet green tea and sweet lemon tea and sweet raspberry tea which they allowed me to taste and try each one. Though the service was a bit slow I think he made up for it for his very kind demeanor and knowledge in regards to the menu. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dish and not many had to take home leftovers. I thought my portion was very adequate and tasty for the price, my chicken dish alone was $17, and in addition to my meal with my drink my tab came out to about $25.
The interior of the restaurant is very modern yet small however they do have some outside seating which is lit up at night. It can be a very romantic dinner if you're looking for a date night."

3) not a lot of variety."
yQO4SLz-vFC7lbXz97Mxyw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Being a foodie I have to give points for the bread they serve and take points for their green salad with the warm dressing. The bread was really good and it had a crust that seemed toasted or grilled, nice touch. The vinaigrette warm dressing had way too much salt, which I suspect was compounded with the prosciutto in the dressing. My scallop dish was done well with a good sear/crust and moist middle. Our service was attentive. With all this said our party went because we had a Groupon and I would need another to step back to this place."
Az4cgnFVhgXjLnQn38DRqg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"This place is located in a shopping plaza in Buckhead.  Small, quaint, and family owned, I stumbled upon this place by chance.

They actually have a great special from 5pm-6:30pm when they first open with a couple of different dinners priced at $10.  Although its not the best Italian I have ever had, and the dishes are relatively simple/standard.  It was quite tasty.  

The service leaves something to be desired....not sure if it was a bad day, or this is just how it is.  

Had the chicken Piccata (one of my favorite dishes) and while a bit buttery it was definitely tasty."
cM8II6RzD7xtm7Jf5He72Q,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Amazing service, food was ok, well prepared but not anything out of the ordinary. The service though was amazing and this is why I gave them 4 stars. I came here for lunch, desserts looked amazing though but I didnt try them. Will come back if I was ever in the mood for a panini (which is what I ordered)."
Xtn4Fz0MlFcFUHnLvaPLng,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,3,"Antonio and staff have gone.  The place has been renovated and looks nice but has lost the ""homey"" feel.  Our server was sweet but, although the menu is the same, the food is not.  The big pastry display is gone, replaced by a coffee bar.  Perhaps not a good expenditure as it seems the place is not very busy.  Sad.  We won't return."
qtPuelex9JWaTmO9Bws9xQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Well, as I suspected, we have returned to this eatery several times.  Often with family or friends in tow.  Last night, hubby had the snapper dinner and deemed it excellent.  I needed something simple and the chef prepared linguine with garlic and EEVO for me, though it was not on last evening's menu.  Prior to the entree we shared the simple, but filling, antipasto and, post-entree, indulged in desserts and espresso.  I am wild about the bombolini!!!  This hedonistic gorging must end....NOT.  Though the menu is on the pricey side, they use quality, imported from Italy, products.  The old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" applies.  Not a place ""to be seen"".  Just authentic, well prepared Italian, non-Americanized food.  Again, bravo!!!"

fTVka9S5A4i6TC_o3Pw-wQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"I am giving this restaurant a 1 star because for a high end hotel to have such a mediocre restaurant is unexceptable. 1st thing is no one was there to greet us when we arrived for a quick snack/lunch from a long 4 hour drive. We sat down and the place was pretty empty with one server on running/ seating guests/ and serving. I ordered one of the flatbread pizzas that listed it had sausage, broccoli rabe, cheese, sauce, and my boyfriend ordered a turkey sandwich. The sandwich comes out with a side salad which was nice with a side of cold hard fries that were sitting under a heat lamp for god knows how long. Mine came out with no broccoli rabe no sauce and fennel all over it with sausage. I asked the waiter why there was no broccoli rabe and he went back to tell the chef/ line cook at the time. Our waiter came back to tell me that the broccoli rabe was in the sauce: blantently lied to my face, there was no broccoli rabe anywhere in that dish. I was very disappointed on how it was handled and when I had asked for a side of sauce he gave me cold ragu paste. I dine at alot of restaurants and I was just so disappointed in the restaurant and staff there, not even to offer can I get you something else, he just walked away."
UEcOGne4gRXA5F0K31HB0g,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"My sister & I went here for fondue - in planning our trip to Boston, I had found a 'Living Social' deal for this.   There was no indication that reservations were required so we were told we could not use the voucher. We were told their tables were full.  

This turned out not to be the case. I even overheard the greeter & her manager trying to figure out how to not honor another customer's voucher who had actually made reservations!

So we stayed for dinner anyway which was a mistake. We got some olives and some mushroom appetizers. They were okay.  We got the lobster roll which was very tuna-salad/chicken-salad'ish but made with tasteless lobster.  I had a glass of wine.  The bill came to over $100.  

Perhaps I felt a bit like a step-child in treatment as they had agreed to let me use the price I paid for the Living Social voucher. But whenever I have to get up & get my own water refills, while the waiters schmooze with the obvious ""regulars,"" my impression of an eating establishment plummets. 

I will not be returning. I would not recommend them to anyone.  Perhaps they will go under soon."
ItnJLUfsG14zy_RIKR3Wpg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"Amazing! My mom, who who typically hates all restaurants, loved every dish at the table. She ordered a small plate of Fettuccine Alfredo and a slice of three cheese pizza. The alfredo sauce was creamy and delicious. The pizza was equally yummy (garlicky and cheesy, mmmm) I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. The marinara sauce was perfect, and the chicken was cooked wonderfully. I think the favorite at the table was my sister's lightly crusted trout. Mildly flavored and perfectly crusted. Yum!
And don't forget to grab a plateful of the homemade chips at the front of the restaurant! 
The staff was super nice. It seemed as though this place may be a favorite among Peachtree Hills locals."
xG2uUmAkV92LxYNXk-Wi8Q,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"Went here for restaurant week yesterday and I must say it was a wonderful experience. Upon entering the restaurant, the host asked if he could take my jacket or bag. I refused but he was nice about it. Then he asked me if I wanted to wait for my friend or sit first and that there was live jazz music until 9pm if I wanted to check that out after my meal (I came at 6pm). So I sat down, the restaurant is really nicely decorated and the service is impeccable!

After I sat down my waitress, Coline, came over and asked if I wanted to order a cocktail as I waited. I decided to wait. Then after my friend arrived, Coline came back and took our drink order. We got a bottle of Riesling. It was good. More on the sweet side but Coline had wonderful suggestions on what to pair it with. We added on the Antipasto for $5. The brie was creamy and melted in my mouth. The cold cuts were amazing! AND OH the bread! I love bread and the focaccia was just delectable! 

So for the appetizer, we got the Lobster Crostina and the Meatballs. Crostina was soooo good. 

For our entrees, we got the catch (Trout) and the Short Rib. The Short Rib was delicious, I wish there was more. The Trout was fantastic. I normally hate fish skin but it was nice and crispy. The fish was seared nicely too.

Our dessert we got the olive oil cake with sorbetto and the tiramisu. Tiramisi was wonderful like everything else. The olive oil cake was nice. Very light. The sorbetto was refreshing.

TWO THUMBS UP!
FIVE STARS!

Amazing service, Coline is the best. So sweet and knowledgeable. Cutest UK accent even though she is French.

Though it's on the pricey side, I would definitely come back!!"
NSubWBfM5ZheyhRjKdZJew,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"It is so hard to give a bad review, because the food was excellent. Once we got it. The problem was, the service was historically poor. It was very disappointing.

So we were a party of four, heading their on a Thursday evening. I called earlier in the week, because we wanted to be outside on the terrace, and was told they don't accept reservations for the terrace. Ok, thats fine.

I got there about 730, and the hostess asked we had a reservations. I told her What I had been told, and she replied something to the matter "" well we didn't, and then did take reservations, and didn't. But when people call and ask I just make them anyways""
Ok, that seem like a good company policy  one that not all employees know
She said 15-20 minutes maybe for a table. ok, fine. I was waiting for the other three in my Part.
Well, after an hour goes by, and we are hungry, we get a bottle of wine at the bar and they bring it to us int he lobby. Finally, after an hour and 20 minutes, at almost 9 we are told the table should be opening up soon. Apparently the guests at the table she thought would have been gone an hour earlier were socializing.

So we went to the table. now dark out, the weather was nice. it is secluded a great spot. We got water, and bread. and no server. After about 15 minutes, we flagged down a server walking by, asking if our server would be coming soon. His reply "" Oh, I guess I can help you. do you know what you want""

We ordered a few cheeses to start. then two of the guests got flatbread pizzas for their meal, and the third got a lobster tail app and two sides form the entree list for a meal, I got an entree and a side, and ordered another drink - Patron reposado on the rocks. not hard to remember. We asked for all the food to come out at once

So then the flatbreads came out.  then my friends app.  then after a little while my entree and her sides. My side never showed up, and since the server we now had couldn't be found (he didn't bring us the food), I was without.
After we ate, he did come back. I asked him about my side and my drink - and he said he must not have heard me ask for the side, and he "" forgot"" about the drink. and apologized. Well, at this point I just wanted to make sure they weren't on the bill.

By this time it was pushing 11 pm, and they were cleaning off the terrace to close up. While we weren't specifically asked, we definitely got the vibe they wanted us to leave. which was fine.

So my meal, the scallops, was amazingly good. the cheeses and bread were great. The wine was good, and everyone enjoyed their food.

But from start to finish, service wise, it was just such a horrible experience. From he long wait, made longer by not having a server, to the order mishaps, to the waiting, and everything. It was pretty much miserable. All four of us have worked in food service, and were appalled by the service. which is really bad, because the food was so tremendous. It is bad that the experience was marred so bad by the staff.

Will I try it again? I want to, since the food was good. But I also don't want to end up with the same service in the future.

I do hope we were just the victims of circumstance, and it isn't the norm for the restaurant. But it left a very negative impression with us."

- Parking was easy to find, which is a feat on The Ave.
- Patio seating with a cover to shelter you from sun/rain.
- Fantastic sangria with freshly cut fruit, and equally as delicious blood orange mimosas.
- Absolutely DELICIOUS food! Bread was great, salad was good, lasagna was incredible. The ocer-the-top mouthgasm dishes were the pene with pesto and the gnocchi alfredo. Holy. Crap. That pesto was an explosion of flavor which my tastebuds couldn't get enough of. I'm not usually a gnocchi fan, but these were soft little pillows of food heaven that molten in your mouth. When paired with the buttery and cheesy alfreado sauce, it was game over. I've found my pasta soulmate! The cannoli was ok, nothing spectacular, but the entrees more than made up for it.
- The food is made in houses from scratch. All of the sauces and most of the pastas. Every day, homemade. Yes please! 
- The service was excellent! Daniel, the GM, took great care of us. Out beautiful server from Venezuela (who's name is escaping me) was a treasure! A lovely person who genuinely cared about your dining experience. She's a rockstar! Trevor, another server, was also fantastic! Great sense of humor and banter when he'd come to the table.

This place is truly a hidden gem in Orlando and I hope more people discover their awesomeness!"
73htxcCgGOuydOgwdWx2yA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Honestly, didn't think it was that great. I went here with my boyfriend and his sister for what we thought was the restaurant week deal. Apparently restaurant week doesn't cover Saturday's, which I realize we should have known, but instead were rudely told by our one of our servers. 
We ate outside at a very dimly lit table.  It was nice, but we wondered what you had to do to score a fire pit table.  The waiter was nice and knew his stuff - he could recommend a good wine to pair with the various foods, but he was less than intrigued by us once we decided to stick with water.  And stick with water we did - the food was really expensive! Average entree cost ~$30. I don't mind paying that, but the food wasn't anything fabulous. It was good, don't get me wrong, but not worth $30. 
So to sum it up: we were a little disappointed. Perhaps it was because we were soured by the experience not being a ""restaurant week deal"" to some extent, but in general, I probably won't be returning."
Q-QUbbTFZffPUCPtGA6cxQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I celebrated my college graduation here.  After the graduation at Boston Garden, my family and my roommates headed to Aragosta for lunch.  There were 27 of us in total and we all enjoyed the lunch very much.  We were set up at a long table in the semi private room near the kitchen.  I worked with Michelle to set up a menu prior to the lunch.  We had a choice of two salads and a choice of three entrees.  The entrees were a chicken, fish, or spaghetti.  I orded the mozzarella and prosciutto salad and the sword fish. The mozzarella was absolutely delicious, a giant ball of mozzarella that was nice and creamy.  The sword fish was equally as delicious, it had a chutney on top, which really made the dish. They also added a personal touch on the menus at the table, writing congratulations and listing the attending graduates names.  I know something like that is little, but it makes for a very nice touch.  I would definitely come back here to try out a normal dinner, and would recommend Aragosta for a large party."

We love trying new places so her brother recommended this joint, and may I say I was quite impressed!  The service was great, the ambiance was spectacular and the scenery was breathtaking! 

As soon as we sat down, a kind, yet very professional young fellow brought out complimentary bread with olive oil, I don't know what the heck they put in that olive oil but it was oh sooo yummy!!!! So far so good....

We weren't too hungry, so we decided to order 3 plates to share...
We ordered the tuna tartare, fried lobster ravioli and littleneck clams. 

Tuna Tartare was very tasteful, with a perfect hint of lime,  tasty pita chips and a small (and quite decorative) egg yolk. 

Up next we ordered the fried lobstahh ravioli, this was probably my favorite out of everything we tried, I was worried if it was going to be too greasy, but it was perfect!  

Last but not least, the clams, also very good! 

For drinks we both ordered the strawberry rum punch, loved it, although I think they could've made them a tad bit stronger. 

So to sum it all up...I recommend! We both left quite satisfied with our experience."

The food is simple but very tasty, extremely well priced and comes in large portions. It is also open for breakfast and is around the corner from where I work so my colleagues and I often stop by for a morning fix. They ALSO have Happy Hour specials so a cold beer, glass of wine or prosecco is nice after a busy day or full week. The staff are always attentive and pleasant and I have yet to have a bad experience with them!

Recommendations:
* The ""French Scrambled"" or a chocolate filled cornetto for breakfast.
* The Chicken Panini or the Quattro Formaggi pizza (with proscuitto) for lunch or dinner
* The dark chocolate cake for anytime"
HM216Hpv38bQzxVsimTe3g,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"3.5 stars is what I want to give but wasn't feeling generous enough to click 4 stars. We went on New Year's Eve and there were ups and downs. Starting with my reservation not being found which wasn't a huge deal since it wasn't packed and we decided to eat at the chef's counter. But first we had a drink at the bar and rather than get a $12 Moscow mule with vodka, ginger syrup and lime, I asked for a pear martini with pear vodka, ginger syrup, lime and a splash of soda water. This however was a whopping $16 and my friend's gimlet was $15, so there was some sticker shock. We then started the 4 course prix fix for $85 with a nice waiter but he seemed to forget about us after the initial interaction. I had to gather the empty glasses and plates and ask him to take them away. Whenever the other guy would bring out our courses, he gave it to the wrong person. Friend's lobster bisque came with a dumpling and a piece of lobster so I asked the chef ""isn't this supposed to be bisque"" and he goes ""Silly server"" and pours the actual liquid. On the other hand, my friend loved the bisque and his whole meal (duck entree and foie gras - I thought the foie was too cold). My poached lobster in butter was great, good gnocchi to start (altho advertised as crispy and there was no crispness going on) and the venison was beyond medium. We both had sticky toffee pudding that was tasty, again he liked it better than I did. The chef was a cool guy and it was fine but not the knockout you hope when you're spending that much money."
oTxFbHhhLG21CDZqwbSSaw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Our waiter was pleasantly attentive, and the food arrived quickly-- it was delicious. We ordered the Al Bacio frittata with asparagus and it was served with ciabatta toast and Brie cheese--a successful combination. Our other dish was a perfect Italian omelette with thin slices of peppers, red onion, and Italian sausage. The coffee was so good we ordered a second cup."
wTDC2_YmZe3XXsdJ41wP4w,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Lobster bruschetta tasted like it was from a can,  molten chocolate cake tasted warmed up from 3 days ago,   Brussel sprouts were under cooked.    Made me wait 20 minutes for a table, when they clearly had 6 tables open,  watched them do the same thing to the couple behind me."
VrRhXseNc64Acz4ejTQDEg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"A group of four of us were in Buckhead on a Thursday night when one of them was craving pasta, but we didn't know where to go.  Per my suggestion, we searched through Yelp and came across Pasta Vino, which was pretty close by.  We trusted that the 4-star average out of 33 reviews shouldn't let us down.

We arrived around 9 pm and were seated immediately.  I was pleased to see that there were at least two other tables of customers dining at the time.  The server gave us the regular dinner menus and also sheets of paper displaying their specials.

After glancing at the menu, I decided to get my favorite Italian pasta dish as a ""Create Your Own Pasta"" - Fettuccine with Alfredo sauce and chicken.  Since I wasn't very hungry, I was pleased to see that they offered two sizes for the pastas - small plate or dinner portion.  After asking the server to describe the small plate size vs. the dinner portion size, I chose the small plate.  To add chicken to a pasta dish, it's usually a $4 charge for the dinner portion.  However, the server informed me that I could add a ""half"" portion of chicken for my small plate for a $2 charge.

While we waited for our food to be prepared, the server brought out a basket of complimentary dinner rolls with butter.  The bread tasted fresh and delicious with the butter, but my friends and I thought it would have been amazing if it was served warm instead of room temperature.  After we finished our first basket, we requested more bread, and the server had no problem getting us some more.

Thankfully, it didn't take much time for our food to be prepared and served to us.

* Fettuccine with Alfredo sauce and Chicken (Small Plate - $9, 1/2 Portion of Chicken - $2) - The portion of the ""small plate"" was pretty much on par with how the server had described it.  I was satisfied with the portion of chicken in the small plate, happy with the amount of sauce on my fettuccine noodles, and thought it tasted good.  It was probably a little better than Olive Garden's but wasn't as good as Mirko Pasta's fettuccine alfredo.  However, I found myself wishing that the fettuccine noodles were wider because they were pretty narrow in size.  Although I didn't finish my small plate and took my leftovers home, I think it's a good size for one person - especially if you are eating the dinner rolls.

Overall, Pasta Vino gets 3.5 stars for their good pasta and friendly service.  However, I didn't find anything particularly unique about the restaurant that would encourage me to return and try their other foods.  If you happen to be in the area and want pasta, Pasta Vino will satisfy the craving, but I wouldn't expect anything really special.

z-zCbssa-MwU-wI_5aWT6A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Finally, a waterfront restaurant that isn't a tourist trap! I'm usually wary of hotel restaurants too as they traditionally cater to the overly pampered vacationers and are often served with a side of sell-out. But not Aragosta!

For starters, loved the Calamari Salad. Loved that they served the calamari rings cold and as is, without covering them in greasy breading. The chilled chewy rings were the best rings a girl could wish for, and the calamari is a girl's best friend at Aragosta.

My entrée was the Fluke. The fish was flaky-fresh, not too heavily seasoned to just appreciate the pure flavor. My dining companion had the Herb Roasted Organic Chicken, a classy, no frills dish. The chicken was juicy with a nice roasted flavor, and I was told that the mushroom polenta was also quite good. 

My fave part of the meal was the dessert, which rarely happens. The refreshing Olive Oil Cake has a refreshing lemon citrus flavor and cold creamy strawberry ice cream. Yummm!!!

Aragosta may be the only place I've ever been to where the quality of the food has absolutely NOTHING to do with its rating on yelp. It's currently averaging a measly 3 stars, which is sadly a step up from the 2.5 at the time of my reservation. I read the reviews, and it seems that many of the poor reviews were based solely on service. If the service was poor at some point in time, I can assure you that it has been fully remedied since then. So if it's good food you're looking for, I urge you to give Aragosta a chance, and I beg you to write a positive review so that this waterfront gem will have a rating that reflects it's top-notch food!"
_5CalScP28hOiK8TlQ7ArA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"My friend and I came to brunch here and we were pretty disappointed. First of all, we got here and were told that the brunch was actually a buffet, which was not on their website or online menu. Additionally, the buffet was expensive (~$30/pp) and not that great. Service was good, however, and the environment was very chill."
#NAME?,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,Great antipasto plate and service.  Thought is was a bit disappointing that they only had a few spots to do the lobster bucket and they only took reservations for it.  As someone not familiar with the restaurant it was something we would have tried.
OvuQ-Do06HoePnHhE48I4A,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,This is a hidden gem on the Ave. I almost want to keep this place a secret. The day was dreary and rainy and my two adult children and I were looking for a nice place to have brunch. All of the usual locations had lines out the door and we didn't want to wait. So we came upon this lovely establishment and check our Yelp and saw they had 4.7 stars and were thrilled excited to try it. It was around noon on a Saturday pre Mother's Day. We were greeted by two nice young ladies. We decided to sit at the bar and I order coffee and a blood orange mimosa and the traditional eggs benedict and a side of crispy bacon. My son ordered a BLT and my daughter ordered the pancakes with strawberries and nutella. It all came out in record time and it was all delicious! We will definitely be back. Thank you to Ninah our server she was outstanding! She told us of the wonderful specials. Pizza Saturday. Happy Hour Specials. A dreary day turned into a delightful experience! Thank you Al Bacio!
6nOiYtl3BKznqkuMNKLVog,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,3,"The food is fantastic but the service needs an upgrade.  I arrived today for lunch and spent a good few minutes literally staring at the servers behind the counter chit-chatting before I literally raised my hand and asked if I could place my order.  Once the restaurant started to fill with more patrons, THEN the staff hopped to it.  The Pasta Napoli - however - was FANTASTIC!  The bread, the sauce, the penne...brilliant!  I did not have to wait long to be served my plate and for at least 5 minutes after being served, my entree was still nice and hot.  Again, the food was excellent.  BUT when I got my bill, my entree was rung up charging a dollar more ($8.99) than it appeared as on the menu ($7.99).  BUT, on the way out I noticed another patron enjoying a plate of steak, eggs, and bread that made my mouth water.  Tighten up your service, AL Bacio, and you'll have bragging rights to real Italian game."
#NAME?,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"It was a crazy weekend in Winter Park with the Sidewalk Festival and I knew this little gem was hiding far beyond the crowds past the Morse Museum, awaiting to fill my hungry tummy. 

Plenty of outside seating with comfortable chairs and sofas if you are digging in to do happy hour, (they have a menu with wine selections) or step inside for little tables along the windows that are incredibly romantic and look out on Park Ave. (which is perfect for people watching.)

The inside was quiet for a Friday night, which was great for the boyfriend and I. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, reminding me very much of restaurants in Europe. The servers were very friendly and attentive. They brought by the delicious warm bread with olive oil and cheese frequently and made sure our drinks never got too low. 

Do note that the menu they have does not include everything they offer. In addition to their fixed menu, they do have a daily menu that you can ask to see. I got this tip from Yelp reviews which was helpful for me because my boyfriend wanted Lasagna which wasn't on the menu. The waiter happily noted they did have it and that it was freshly baked earlier today. I ended up choosing the classic Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti and it did not disappoint. 

The sauces are natural tasting, fresh, and filled with Italian herbs (my fav.) Everything about my meal made me extremely happy and the prices are quite reasonable. I would say Al Bacio é multo autentico and would definitely please the taste buds. I hear good things about breakfast, looking forward to coming back!"
seS7WcMLEWV0fTnzhl03Cw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I came with my expectations in check after reading some mixed reviews here on Yelp but men, I was pleasantly surprised. We had reservations for the terrace but it was nippy and they sat us inside promptly. I found the service all through the night exceptional and not lacking in any way. The waiters were courteous and frequently checked in to make sure we were satisfied.

 The atmosphere is definitely upscale but we didn't find it overly snubby or elitist, just nice and comfy. The place was spic span and shiny, definitely well maintained. The bathrooms were really nice as well, a very nice touch all around. The restaurant is at the base of the Fairmont Hotel (which we didn't know) but that wasn't an issue. Valet parking for less than you would pay to park yourself. 

We tried a few things off the menu....lamb meatballs & aragosta insalata to start. The meatballs were glorious and the platter was also quite tasty (apart for the mustard sauce thing, yuck, that was pretty much the only bite that wasn't 4-5-star all night). We had the lobster tagliatelle and roasted chicken both of which were awesome (though I didn't like the balsamic sauce mixed with the corn and squash). We finished off with the Tiramisu....if not for anything else we ate, that heavenly Tiramisu was worth the entire dinner and $100+ tab :). Absolutely the best tiramisu we have ever had. Try it and you will surely not be disappointed.

 The only negative thing I have to say about Aragosta is that the service did seem a bit slow. While the waiters were great and frequently checked on us, it took almost an hour to actually get our Main courses from when we sat down and the place was about 70-80% full so not terribly busy. Though the apps came out fairly quick. 

 Right next door is the Battery Lounge, the Live Jazz band came on around 9pm. It was quite pleasant to have that going in the background while having dinner. And while we didn't stick around long after dinner in the lounge, the place was full of after-dinner patrons just soaking in the nice music with drinks. Very nice. I will definitely be going back to Aragosta, I also like it is in a 'quieter' section of the north end away from all the chaos."
sVSEhlSWI3nkhHeC--GH5w,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews. I went here last night after work for a little girls night, and they were running a ""Dine Out Boston"" pre fixe. First things first, this place is huge. We decided to seat ourselves in the front lounge are, at a table by the windows. The view was gorgeous, and made for a nice setting. 

The service here is really quite impeccable. From host to server, everyone was fantastic. We came on a slower evening, so the bartender was also our server (Pat). We opted to stick with prosecco during our meal (Super girly, I know). He was really sweet and later on, he offered us complimentary dessert wine with our last course. While I don't have a taste for dessert wines, this one paired really well with what we chose. 

As for the meals, my friend ordered the Caesar salad for her first course, and I opted for the mixed greens with poached egg. The salads were pretty big in portion. The tomatoes on my salad were incredibly juicy, the egg was nicely poached, and it had a lovely reduction on it. 

For our second course, we both opted for the bolognese. It was slightly different from most I've had, but the rigatoni was al dente, the meat was nicely cooked, and the creaminess was just the right consistency. I also thought the portion was just perfect. I usually don't order pasta when I go out to eat because I hardly make a dent in it before I'm full. This was a great portion size for a 3-course, leaving me with just enough room for dessert. My only complaint was the meat-to-pasta ratio. My girlfriend and I both agreed that we could have done with a few more rigatonis, and just a tablespoon or so less of the bolognese. Otherwise, it was really delicious. 

For dessert, she ordered the crème brûlée, and I ordered the tiramisu. Both were served with a few pieces of biscotti (which I loved). The tiramisu was moist and melted in my mouth, and it came with a scoop of coffee gelato, so it was total heaven. 

All in all, I would say this makes for a good spot to go on a more intimate date. I would definitely come back here with my boyfriend. The views are gorgeous, the service is on par, and the food is comparable in quality to most North End locales. I can definitely see myself coming here after work in the summer and enjoying a drink outside on the wharf, as well."

  Every dish was excellent with a beautiful presentation, along with a more than generous wine pour.  The whole staff from  the chef and her staff to the waiter and bartender were so gracious. We met another couple from Canada and had a 2 hour dining experience and never once felt rushed. What a wonderful evening in Boston."
HWV_UPmSpYeJNxxlGV-eGg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,"We have been a patron here for over 20 years.   We recently did a take out. When home we found that one of the salads was spoiled.   We also noticed that there is now a take out charge.   We called and the lady apologized for the salad ( which they never applied.)

When asked about the takeout charge she became defensive and said it was for the containers.  What about this saving the a table and cleanup???

She then Hung up on us. 

Patrons no more."
_s0794Pbsz8kPgGeWCwdPQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Al Bacio is located on the quiet end of the Park Ave shopping and restaurant district. 

They offer salads, paninis, burgers, pastas, desserts, beer, wine and coffee. Something for everyone. 

And, a great place to have coffee, a meal and get some work done. They have a bar area with outlets and USB ports. 

It's an excellent spot for a quiet meal. The staff is attentive. Their food is always fresh, desserts delicious and coffee freshly made.

The Caffé Al Baccio is a singularly delicious dessert coffee. Served in a champagne flute - it's layered with chocolate, white chocolate and caramel. 

The owner stopped by our table and suggested the hot chocolate - then offered us a sample. It's really nothing like I've had before. A dessert on its own - very rich and so very chocolatey. I highly recommend!"
sksOlBI2fgrWax1OAE3QnQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Great food! A little pricey, I think because food is imported and it is located in Winter Park. Ask for Danilo!"

Id2TfavUHiYjxxhxggKisA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"The food was not good. And the prices were expensive. Bad combination. I wouldn't complain if this was supposed to be ""cheap"" Italian food, but the quality was amazingly bad. $21 for 3 terrible-tasting, thinly sliced pieces of lemon flavored veal? I work in an old folks home, and our cook there makes better veal. Additionally, the other dishes were just plain bad.
 I cook better food; I just didn't want to do dishes tonight- but the price did not equal the quality. As we speak, my girlfriend is re-heating her order in a pan on the stove top  and adding spices. My son ate the spaghetti because he doesn't know any better."

The service is always impeccable, especially Jay and Zaman. They always treat us like family. There's almost always a crowd but you never have to wait long. Reasonably priced and great selection -truly something for everyone. (Even kids.) We love you Pasta Vino! :)"
ukZiYao_k_awaxazsmomQQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"The tiramisu is a must try! Patrick, the bartender is simply delightful. My fave drink was made perfectly. Love the ambiance and vibe of the place. My ravioli was ok, not much to brag about but the olives and ciabatta were really good. 

I would definitely return!"
kXcHEg0c6ywCDAuRxyPjvQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Pasta Vino is a neighborhood staple. You know what you're going to get and you feel comfortable going. It's not a showy, trendy type place but a family, local, casual/dressy date night place. It's dimly lit and offers standard Italian fare that doesn't disappoint. Order the fish cooked to buttery perfection or the chicken francese. They now offer gluten free pasta which is a treat! The 4-cheese sauce is heaven. Must try at least once and you'll add this to your repertoire of ""go-to"" restaurants."
GH-lHwLmjCEoZFjyfyMX4g,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"I rarely write reviews on Yelp, but want to save your time and money. From the unfriendly wait staff to waiting over 45 minutes for apps and another 45 for entree which was obviously nuked from sitting out too long, I can't emphasize enough how unimpressed we were. I observed the unfriendly woman who poured our water cutting bread with bare hands. Our waiter kept coming to the table awkwardly to see if the check was ready , but was nowhere to be found otherwise. The decor was top notch, but everything else needs major improvement! Save your money and go to the north end."
CPbk2ryf4bIdNqFUmvUujQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Mine was very good.
Boyfriend's was ok.
Mom's was terrible.

I really wanted to give a good review, but lots of inconsistency at my table. I actually thought the spaghetti and meatballs was great; the sauce was delicious. Boyfriend got the rigatoni with italian sausage; it looked good, but I didn't try it. Mom got the chicken marsala; the chicken was tough and the sauce wasn't very recognizable as masala.

They ended up taking the chicken off the bill (when we said they really didn't have to). Kudos for that.

The house chianti is not very good.

Quiet, pleasant atmosphere inside. Patio looked fun.

Staff was friendly and likeable, but a little awkward when it came to dining experience.

I would actually go again, but I'd think twice before wining and dining a group of friends here."
RL1NEJ1oxogq8Lvk2g3W_w,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"We hadn't been to this place for about seven years. We moved back into town and finally got a chance to come back to whenever old favorites. It used to remind me of one of those family Italian restaurants up in New York or Boston. Nothing too fancy but everything was really good. 

Now, I just want to know what happened? Everything was either mediocre or poor.  The problem was that the grouper I ordered and the gnocchi  that my daughter ordered, tasted like some sort of Italian dish that was soaked in olive oil, grease and butter.  Has the ownership changed or something?"
j4IFqIifmUPiSf7XtH55Gg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Always such a pleasure to be recognized by staff here, even when it's been months! Order the al bacio Benedict on Sundays! It's delicious."
bD7SglpuvbOSCuwElOcImg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"I can tell this is a business where they take pride in customer experience. I've ordered the daily pasta special both times I've visited and absolutely loved it. 

The ingredients are high quality and full of rich flavor. The servers are attentive and sincere and my favorite part is that similar to the Italian culture, they don't rush you to finish your meal and be on with the next customer. We spent a bit of time sitting outside enjoying the weather and sipping on our cappuccinos. Next time I am looking forward to trying one of those beautiful little pastries."
uCQYMfY9RT-ZQLrSSujs_w,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"I love this place! The long-time waitstaff is so friendly, I think they actually like their jobs! If you're looking for basic Italian, nothing frou-frou, then this is the place. Everything I've ordered has been delicious, and if you want something that's not on the menu, they have no problem preparing it. People are catching on, so it's more busy than it used to be, but weeknights are still usually a safe bet."
Z5p0yKoTCfmNUPLvco1DLA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,This is the worst Italian food and service I have ever had in Atlanta I didn't even realize you could screw up pasta so bad the only thing tasty was the garlic bread I think this has changed ownership / I want to believe there has to be some reason it wasn't just me the whole table was extremely disappointed and we will never go back again
o4ihXcapLlugCBU2HZ4yIg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Went to this place on a whim and it was a nice surprise. We had average service but the ravioli was great! They buy locally made fresh ravioli that is really good. I had the truffle oil and mushroom ravioli and it was great. Nice place, not pricy, and good food."
i_bbko3yo8wqYPPKxXUJkA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Worst hospitality service ever. Came here for breakfast and the female server was awful. First, she took the wrong order. Then I watched as the food sat on the counter for at least 15 min because she decided to chat with someone on the side. When we got tired of waiting, I asked another server to check on the food. He brought it over promptly, but it was cold and my order was wrong. Then the female server brought the check and overcharged us. She was nowhere to be found so I again, asked a different server about the charge. He comped the meal as it was a mistake. I grabbed one of the managers to let them know the details and the female server came over to tell me I was wrong and the charge was not a mistake because we were comped. We were comped because I pointed out the mistake in the first place!!!!! If I hadn't said anything we would have been overcharged!' She then proceeded to argue with me on this point until I finally said enough and left. I have never experienced such rudeness from anyone in the hospitality industry. I never complain but this was completely ridiculous. They really need to hire better staff. Otherwise prepare to lose more customers. I travel to Boston often for work and I will never return to this restaurant or hotel again"
7pnnoC3fprVD97U8nVkBFg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"We had a 8:30pm reservation on a Saturday. We waited until 9:15pm to be seated. However the restaurant was packed so they seated us in the lounge, which was fine since there was live jazz. A server came by shortly after and handed us menus. We then waited for a little over 25 minutes and did not receive any further service: not even water. We decided to leave at this point due to how frustrated (and hungry) we were.

We walked passed the host station on our way out, but no one said anything. However, a bus person began clearing our table as soon as we got up!

We headed to Hanover street and got some hearty Italian and friendly service (at a fraction of the cost)"
jyCt_vmf1W4ikvQVicNlIg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I was surprised how bad the food was. I had an appetizer, main dish, desert and a non alcoholic cocktail. The 3 stars i give are for the desert only.... the food and a drink were terrible! 

The service was good, and yes, the views are just amazing."
D6EyoECLVBS4BAjqfGAtPQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"What a shame that this place has a sign outside of the restaurant that says ""Bar and Bistro"".   I visited the first time thinking ""oh well, I'm tired and will settle for bar food"".  I was stunned at the quality of the dinner, and very much enjoyed it.  I actually called my son (who has worked at a Top-10-In-The-World restaurant in Manhattan) and raved about the food.  

I have repeated the visits probably ten times now, and nine were excellent and one visit was just OK.   In general, the entrees are very creative and spiced by a very talented chef.   On his best nights, the food can be almost world-class.  But the place needs to stop trying to be all things to all folks.   Tonight I told the waiter and the general manager that a chef of this caliber won't work forever under a ""bar and bistro"" sign, while the couple sitting at the next table over were wondering where the burgers were on the menu (honest!).   

This would be my favorite restaurant in Boston if the menu had a few more items that really showcased the chef's talent."

LjZn6LP3MLxiF10HpoDdFA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Disappointed in the customer service of the the bar. I bought the living social deal in April for Gruyere and fondue at the fire pits. I thought it would be a great anniversary dinner for my boyfriend and I, so we waited until he was back living in the area to go.

I checked the voucher, as well as the website to see if I needed to make a reservation, and I saw the the patio was first come first serve from 5-10. We got there at 530 (with only 3 parties outside maybe) and that's when I was told I had to have a reservation. I told her that it didn't say that anywhere and she admitted that the deal was so popular and they changed it and they're updating the website. Of course, I also so plenty of room for a table for two which was also discouraging.

That is unacceptable, in my opinion. I have no doubt the hotel and the food here is exceptional, so it's just not a good way to present yourself as having a not up to date website. I've had this since April and there's no reason why a simple line of text saying 'if you have a voucher you need to make a reservation' especially if the deal is so popular I can't have been the only one to deal with this. And on too of that, she recommends calling a week or two in advance. So yes, a website update is needed ASAP

To anyone who has the voucher, I hope you've read this and know know what I didn't."
ptgkPOgIPH3QYtO_h3vXcg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"The waitstaff were uninformed about the menu (where items were sourced, terminology, flavor descriptions, etc.), had no clue about wine or wine pairings (for the ridiculous up-charge on mediocre wine, they better at least provide a story behind it), and overall their demeanor perfectly matched the bland and beige feeling of the restaurant.

The food?  Forgettable.  I understand that this is a 'hotel' restaurant, but it seems that the Fairmont went out of the way to find a mediocre Italian Chef to try and bank on North End authenticity.  Obviously frozen baguettes and store-bought low to medium quality cold-cuts a charcuterie platter does not make.  The one saving grace was the level of seasoning on fish dishes, keep the fish cook and fire everyone else."
XGcBwBjtK3E3aC5kMTqtoQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"We were looking for something different from our usual Park Ave. breakfast spots and are sure glad we ventured a block past our usual Panera stop to find Al Bacio. We were 20 minutes before opening time but the front door was open so we ventured in and were warmly greeted. The gentleman behind the counter offered us coffee immediately and made us feel welcome so we found a table on the front patio and settled  in for our special breakfast experience. The Fritata Bacio and Italian Crostada were fabulous and the attentive service made us feel like we were on a 1 hour vacation. The Italian music added to the ambiance and the friendly, social atmosphere amongst the regular customers made for a memorable meal. The only problem was that we didn't save room for one of the wonderful looking pastries. But we will rectify that next visit which will be soon."

I liked the ambience and service too."

If you can get a table outside do it, much better views and there are fireplaces to keep you warm and the bugs away. I had the scallop dish and my boyfriend had the gnocchi, both were excellent.

dWMvDJ6gy7fyr5xOcnH7iA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I have no idea how Aragosta in the Fairmont Hotel has an overall rating of only 3 stars. I have been several times over the last 6 months and have yet to be disappointed. Highly recommend sitting at the chef's table at night or if the weather permits, staking claim to one of the firepit tables outside or sitting on the back patio. Be sure to try the Aragosta Frittata, Stuffed Chive Crepes or Blueberry Muffin French Toast at Brunch. And for dinner, the Goat Cheese and Black Pepper Gnocchi or Seared Georges Banks Scallops. Great food, great service and an elegant setting... I can't wait to go back."
5tuxSIjL6SiJ5FKFKWLt0Q,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Located in the Peachtree Battle shopping center, Pasta Vino is a somewhat hidden but I'm okay with that.  The first time I went there we sat in the dining room, which is fairly small, but the ambiance made us feel like we were in some quaint neighborhood restaurant in Little Italy or something.  The service was really attentive and friendly and I always appreciate that.  

The food...oh, the food.  First of all, portion sizes are pretty large, which is to be expected, so come ready to eat.  I had the chicken parmesan since it was listed as a signature dish and I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of chicken parm (not really) and I was not disappointed.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the chicken was seasoned just right.  The sauce was lovely and all was right in the world.  My friends both had the Liguini ai Frutti di Mare and both thought they had died and gone to Italy.  By their impressions, I'm guessing that was a good thing.  The wine list was pretty decent and while the prices were a tad on the high side, it was definitely worth it."
9XsoYX1pfJs0Y9xFArhDhg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Totally hidden away in the Peachtree Battle shopping center, just about underneath a Cheyenne Grill. Parking is free, in the Publix parking lot-yay!

Delicious eggplant parm. Their menu claims it's the best in town. I don't know about that, but it was pretty darn good. Came here on a date, and it's definitely a cute first date spot. Menu seems to have a good variety of Italian staples. Pizza, pasta and salads. 

Prices aren't too bad either. Wish I had opted to eat outdoors-the patio looks nice. 

Decor inside is a little strange, but might be cute and trendy, depending on preference. My date loved it and I was on the fence. 

Service a little slow when we went, and just average. Wasn't really a busy night either. 

All in all, a cute neighborhood Italian place, definitely my go-to the next time I'm in south Buckhead and someone is craving Italian. Would love to try more of the menu."

I am not sure what happened but I went last night hoping to have a nice dinner and was thoroughly disappointed. There was no hostess, and one bar tender who was also the only server in the room. 

Charcuterie plate had meats and cheeses which quality were that of the ones in a 7/11.

The rock shrimp lettuce wraps smelled so foul I refused to eat them and sent them back.

At that point I was thankful I had not ordered a meal yet and decided to cut my loses and ask for the check."

We waited about 15 minutes to be approached//spoken to by anyone (including the host-they were...speechless).

Once the server came by, things seemed to get better and the food was very good.

Chicken Parmesan and gnocchi were hits. The bread they bring to table is Divine.

Nice outdoor atmosphere if the weather permits.

Probably won't come back here...as long as I remember this bizarre service. Just can't justify paying to be overlooked the way we were.

Shoutout to the teenage Server who seemed to be doing everyone's job for them. He deserves a raise!"

I ordered a berries and bubbles cocktail which is a mix of fresh berries, champagne and Grey Goose.  It was light, refreshing and delicious.  The view of the harbor was pretty breathtaking, too.  The only downsides were that we were required to order food, even though we just wanted cocktails, and everything on the menu is really, really expensive."
E_EAkX_wDIrd0ddRNS49iQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Had a terrible experience here.  Went to dinner with friends during Restaurant Week - a time during which you would think a restaurant would want to showcase their food and gain new customers - and I have to say I will likely not return.  I live in the area and walk by often so I was dying to have some food and drinks on their gorgeous patio.  My friend and I made reservations 3 weeks in advance and specifically requested an outdoor table.  When we arrived we were told we'd be seated inside and an outdoor table would be an hour and a half wait.  First strike.  They sat us and our table was directly next to the bar and so noisy.  Not a huge deal but annoying since we were really hoping to be outside.

Next comes the service.  Started out good, went downhill fast.  Drink orders were messed up or just didn't come at all.  Empty glasses were all over the table.  We sat without cocktails or water for lengthy stretches of time.  Once we finally ordered, it took FOREVER for our food to come.  I totally understand the kitchen being backed up or a waiter being very busy but neither of those things appeared to be happening.  

In total, we were there for over 2 and a half hours waiting for our courses of food to come.  I ended up leaving my debit card with a friend and going home because I was just so annoyed.  When our food did finally arrive, it just was not good.  Some of the appetizers were decent - friends had the flatbread which they loved.  I got the risotto for my main entree and it wasn't inedible but I definitely make better risotto myself in my kitchen with no real cooking experience.  Everything was underseasoned.  I barely ate my meal.  

I spoke to the manager at one point and alerted him to what was going on, expressing my disappointment in the food and the service.  He was apologetic but did nothing to rectify the situation.  I talked to him after our appetizers were out and we still waited about an hour for our meals.  

Needless to say, for the money we spent and the service/food quality we got, I was not happy and certainly won't be back anytime soon except maybe for a fool-proof glass of wine on the patio...if they allow me to sit there."
JlPS0v8s51AELCXi-ZxyPw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,We had the Gnocchi Pasta Vino and the Goat Cheese and Apple Ravioli. It was great!! The price was expensive but at least it was delicious! I will definitely be back.
3g5vl2S1iecoMLXs--5uEA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"A friend and I dined here for Restuarant Week this past Friday with 9pm reservations. I noted on the OpenTable reservations a request for outdoor seating if the weather was ok. We arrived at about 8:55pm and were told we would have to wait 30 minutes for an outdoor table, or 15 minutes for a table inside even. As a customer that made reservations weeks ago with the special request, I found this totally unacceptable. We waited and had a pitcher of sangria in the lobby. When our table was finally ready the hostess said to leave our sangria, they would bring it right over. After 10 minutes, I mentioned to our waiter about our sangria. 15 minutes after that he came back with 2 new glasses of sangria and said the other two glasses got ""lost"".

The food was decent. Great truffled fries. The lobster bisque and chicken entree was average, nothing special. Our server wasn't overly attentive. The patio started clearing out and after waiting with empty plates on our table for 15 minutes, the server came over and said that he would have to move us inside for dessert because the patio ""closes"" at 10:30. Perhaps if the service was quicker and we were seated on time, this wouldn't have been an issue!

Neither my friend or I had been here before, both having lived in Boston our entire lives, and perhaps theres a reason."
BYgbaebIQXHd790fHIwq4A,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"I do like PV. Last night was another hit - but mainly enjoyed today. We had calamari in store and my favorite server took great care of us, and ordered the chicken Francese (side of pasta marinara) and a penne with vodka sauce to go. Never got to the leftovers til today! I cheffed up the marinara by adding a little fresh mozz and dried oregano, and heated some of the rolls they were kind enough to send home with us. Add a glass of the Malbec he got and barely had any of, so we brought it home, and I had a perfect and easy dinner after a hectic day of work!

Italian on the ready. Love, amore, perfect! (May get to that chicken later . . . )"
HbeRqBD8remFp2dcvgmubg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I feel bad for Aragosta - they deserve more stars than what they have. I definitely had a good experience here and hopefully my review can convince some people to not shun away from this restaurant due to the star rating.

Before anyone start thinking I am one of workers of Aragosta or Fairmont hotel -- I am not!!! I came to Boston from New York for the MLK long weekend with my boyfriend and decided out of convenience and to avoid the 7 degree weather to dine at this restaurant -- we were not disappointed.

Service - which seemed to be the problem in most of these reviews. But seriously, I am someone who judges a restaurant based on the food, not the service. Nevertheless, the waiter who served us was perfectly polite & very knowledgeable of the menu - gave us food recommendations and was attentive the entire time. 

Food - Exceeded beyond my expectations. The lobster crostini was sooo yummy, delicious and had such juicy pieces of lobster complimented with the taste of truffle. Charred octopus salad was served with pieces of fingerling potatoes done perfectly. Personally, I love the bitterness from the charred octopus though some may not be a fan. We had the Pappardelle Bolognese, Veal Cheek & Ox Tail Ragu main to share and they politely split into two plates. They definitely came looking as if it was one portion each! Topped off with a piece of melting brie cheese on a rolled up piece of pasta standing in the ragu, I was very impressed with the presentation (not to mention that the pasta was thoughtfully seasoned in between with herbs and cheese.)

Dessert was okay but we only ordered gelato. The bread pudding looked good but we were too STUFFED to try anything else.

All in all, great food, great service for my experience. Honestly I felt really bad at the end of my dining experience that we were the ONLY people dining in this restaurant. I mean for this quality of food, there should be more people!!! My four stars might not be enough to salvage their current 2 star average - but if you happen to stay at Fairmont hotel and happen to read this, give them a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised."
vqYN5ZThb3HmDtnSSw2E6g,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"The food is pretty good, I really like the goat cheese Apple ravioli. However, I was really disappointed by the service tonight. My date and I ate an entire bread basket and still no one has brought us water. Then when I flagged down a server to ask for some he just told us another sever would take our order...okay, and mind you, we were one of only two parties in the restaurant so they weren't busy. Another 5 minutes pass, still no waters. I flag down another server and ask for some and he looks at me like I'm making some absurd request to ask for waters...it was weird.  But the food was good. The service was just awkward and oddly slow."
4ozixNHTZhZoUETGPttTFg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,Love the location and they sell my favorite coffee brand Lavazza. The staff is friendly and easy going. Bianca was very engaging and personable. The food we ordered came out steaming hot and was cooked to order! Love it definitely will be back :-)
JE9PEPFYrIymSzRviG8p6A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"My wife found a living social forager on  tea for two at this wonderful location. We were in Boston during the weekend of January and thought the warm tea would be a delightful treat. We arrived and were impressed with the wonderful view of bay. We were greeted and our coats quickly checked as we were lead to the sitting area with comfortable arm chairs and couches. (I would encourage you to ask for a couch if you are there for a date as opposed the arm chairs ). The waiter ,Tanner, was helpful and very conscientious. I had the Japanese Kyoto tea and my wife had the wild berry and blossoms. Both were delicious and Tanner was happy to add more water to our French presses to make sure we always had tea. The three plate tower came out with a wide variety of tea party snacks; my wife's favorite was the scones with Devonshire cream and preserves while mine was the chicken salad on the rye bread. A great little relaxation time with great food. The experience would have been pricey without the living social coupon so if you can find the coupon make it a date."
SmeL7oTyVfxnUUuwn7QfUw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"My favorite little gem of an Italian restaurant! Food is great and prices are very fair. Be prepared to ask the wait staff for a refill on water/bread etc, but they are all very sweet! Our personal favorites are the gnocchi and the lasagna dishes. Also try the white Alfredo dipping sauce with the bread, delicious!"
oRsHfi5WkVOCRU-j2NnEPQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Great service, even better food! They have superior pizza here and you can't go wrong with the toppings! Chicken parm is so spot on too! And for all you gluten intolerant, they offer gluten free pasta. Love it!"
lDDOSUSYZKSy7PYifibbwQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Went here for breakfast, first of all, we waited about 5-6 minutes for them to set up our table  (we had our 2, 5 and 7 year old with us). Then when we got to the table, it took another 5 minutes to get a high chair. They were not at all busy, I might add. The menu was AMAZING, it really was, great gluten free options and alternative meat options to those who don't dig on swine. I am a huge brrakfast menu snob and this menu rocked. The food, however, was ok-ish. Took a long time to get it though, so did the children's cup of water for my thirsty 2 year old. We're staying here for three days, and I will not be going back which stinks because it's highly convenient to go to breakfast in the same hotel you're staying. Looks like it might be better for the dinner crowd."

Service was top-notch and we got seated outside, which was my absolute favorite part of the whole experience. They have beautiful flowerbeds, umbrella topped tables, chairs by the water, and a stunning view of the boston seaside. Unforgettable experience here and would definitely return for a non-restaurant week menu."
0s6O7P7_TJU4voKGuw1GbA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Meh! Food was ok, but not worthy of the price. The ambience is very nice and service was good, but I cannot justify a $70 tab for two lunches unless the food is spectacular. this was not.
I shall not return."

For dinner, had the snapper which was also amazing, and came with a wonderful light garlic oil pasta."
AoLQLdxMgH-yP-AR0UZcrg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,This place is amazing. The food was extraordinary and Pasquale was fantastic.  His service and his personality made everything even more memorable.  Thank you Pasquale.  We will be back .

We ordered the cheese plate and it was very generous portions of both the meats and cheeses. My girlfriend is plowing through them like there's no tomorrow:)

Great place."
HqrweYKz-GWYXhP3Y7b2xA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Stopped in one afternoon this week for my favorite pastry La Sfogliatella, (Lobstertail). It is the only place in the Orlando area that seems to make it. The flaky wrapped pastry cradles a lovely pastry cream inside. I was blown away by the bakery case - a beautiful array of fine Italian pastries - wishing I could try each one.  Humidity does a number on lobster tails in Florida  (making them a little tougher) but I was still happy to have one.  I also tried a terrific chocolate tort.  In the case a nutella tart stared at me but I had to say no this time. 
Decided I had to try their breakfast and went with a friend after we played singles (in tennis) for 2 hours).  I needed to burn extra calories before visiting again. She ordered the most gorgeous omelet I have ever seen - loaded with fresh vegetables including edamame pouring  out of it, served with two slices of ciabatta bread and a nice fruit cup.  I ordered the corncake with cheese. Both were excellent. Since this was going to be my main meal of he day the corn cake was filling and loaded with melted cheese and a drizzle of a balsamic glaze swirled on the plate..  I am a new fan, I like that it is on the quiet end of park ave . Looking forward to trying the sandwiches, pastas and salads.  I know I will be makign regular detours just to pick up a few sweets."
s3LIOkmNYW-iBRlWMRP-MQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"I can't understand why this place isn't 4 stars on Yelp.  It is everywhere else. The food is delightful and delicious.  Chef Daniels' tuna flat bread is one of the best dishes I've had since recently moving back to Boston.   Make sure to sit at the bar in front of the kitchen where you can the magic going down with this talented team.

If I could criticize this restaurant on anything, it would be the dining room decor.  Being set in a newer hotel, the furnishings and surroundings are very sterile and contrived, which is a strange juxtaposition to such authentic food."
1G0zHLL57oYYNPSm6cy2IA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"I went here with my two friends after finding this lovely place right here on Yelp. It was great! Our waiter was so cheery and attentive (without being overly so). I couldn't decide between two dishes, so he said he had me covered and chose for me-- I ended up with the Mediterranean gnocchi-- and it was so delicious! 

It's a cute place with lovely people, and I definitely recommend this place for any occasion!"
aYf4Iq6AFtr_QBGUVJG99Q,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"My friends and I were pleasantly surprised by the quality, great service, and relaxing atmosphere. The music selection for a Sunday afternoon was a little surprising, with reggae jams instead of something low-key, but maybe we were the only table desiring to chat. The brunch restaurant week menu offered many great options - the star dishes were: the coast guard omelet, the seasonal fruit parfait, and the eggs benedict. 

Thanks again to the great staff for being attentive and patient even though they were working on a lovely Sunday."
4N4Or1ShFBcny7E2IDe7yw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,Been here several times but today just ruined it. They turned away two parties because the tables were dirty and they have a process for cleaning them that takes 30 mins! I walked through the place and there was not one dirty table. They just can't handle being busy and is quite embarrassing to be turned away because your too busy with one party of 12 and two other parties of 5.
Zf5AJBaXWwWyFdBydK0MvQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,This is the worst Italian food and service I have ever had in Atlanta I didn't even realize you could screw up pasta so bad the only thing tasty was the garlic bread I think this has changed ownership / I want to believe there has to be some reason it wasn't just me the whole table was extremely disappointed
SH_qG6XWn6w4_5EYGTBv9Q,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"I REALLY wanted to like this restaurant because it's a great location and has wonderful menu selections and it has the potential to be so fabulous, but falls short of expectations on so many levels. We arrived at 6:50 for a 7:00 reservation and because it was such a beautiful summer evening expressed our interest in dinning outside.  When walking toward the restaurant, we had seen many open tables and thus were shocked when told it would be a 20-30 minute wait to eat outside despite there being 4 open tables (none of which were seated during our 30 minute wait). The hostess also had a big chip on her shoulder and gave us a lot of attitude from our first interaction with her.  We enjoyed drinks at the bar but by 7:30, no one had come to find us to seat us or to let us know the wait was going to be longer than estimated - we had to go seek out the hostess and remind her we were waiting!  We finally got seated and waited, and waited and waited. A waiter came by and we told him we wanted to order, he said he would get our server, no one came. A member of our party went to the bathroom and told another waiter we wanted to order, no one came. FINALLY after 30 minutes of sitting at the table without water, bread or any acknowledgement, the manager came over and I told him we had been sitting for 30 minutes and were ready order and only then did someone finally come take our order.  Our food was good and we were given a complimentary antipasto platter for the inconveniences of the evening, but the poor service and disorganization I experienced make this restaurant, unfortunately, a one-time only experience.  So Aragosta, if there read these reviews, FIGURE IT OUT, no one has had anything good to say about your service, and good food can only get you so far, especially when it takes so long to get to the table!"
fgbgeRhOLCzxivfCMRtZUA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"If you want real italian, go to a place in the north end.  This place had terrible food...was salty and of mediocre quality.  Honestly, I expected better of the Fairmont.    The only saving grace was the view.  My advice, go for a drink for the view, pass on the food."
bBbAigJMCQow40MMwCcOjA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Hello. I went here last night with my wife, son and another family. The place is clean and family friendly. The pasta here is very good and the servings sizes are perfect for children (ours are 11,12,15). The food was generally considered very good by everyone.

I had the goat cheese and apple ravioli. Very good.
My wife had the veal franchese. Very good
My 11 year old son had spagetti and meatballs and thought the meatballs were some of the best he ever had.

The other family: the adults had chicken franchese and chicken marsala; very good. The kids had gnocchi with meat sauce (the 15 year old ate it all and liked it and I'm not sure what the girl had.

Over all everyone enjoyed their meal and we had different salads which we all thought were good but nothing special.

The one compliant we all shared was that serving sizes on all non pasta dishes were a little small. Mine in particular was a bit surprising as they only gave me four regular sized ravioli. Had I known that I would have ordered something else. So if you are very hungrey and want a lot of food or if you want a place that is really special with a unique menu this is not the place to go. If you want good food that is a good family place then this is a nice restaurant to visit. 

Unless I'm in the area again I don't see any reason to go back but if there is justification to go back then I will not have a problem with it."
nu1kmt7oXL3yoPknZTyjlA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"I do not even know where to begin. This was one of the most horrific dining experiences I have ever had. Rude, rude rude! A waiter corrected a member of our party when he ordered a bottle of wine he's had many times. The manager interrupted our fondue to come tell me that my Groupon had already been redeemed (it hadn't, I clicked ""redeemed"" as soon as I read the number to the waiter) and then he had the gall or ague with me. Additionally, after accepting a reservation at 9:00, the made sure to let us know multiple times that they closed at 10:30. I know we had Groupons, but we wouldn't have made a trip to this restaurant without it. We still ordered two bottles of wine and several cocktails. There is no excuse for this service. AVOID."
ojdLGAv7zWQB02C_wjvpKw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Food was good, not great. Terrible
Management. No hostess. Had to wait for over 10 minutes for one of the two waitresses working to seat us. No people to clear tables. Tables remained uncleared with old food from before we sat down through our meal. Yes that'll right, uncleared tables for over an hour. Servers were fine but needs managerial overhaul."

I had lobster ravioli he had the turkey stuffing and while my dish was perfect, I found myself taking bites out  of his plate. The mashed potatoes stuffing were out of this world ! For dessert we had the apple crisp and that was just amazing.
The staff was great polite !!' 
Definitely a must."

It was a gorgeous summer day so we sat outside and had a drink, oysters and olives. We came back 2 days later! This time we split the Kobe burger that came with a salad and truffle Parmesan fries.  OMG probably the best I have ever had ! Eric was our waiter and we loved how friendly and professional he was.  His service was the icing on the cake for an experience that was already fantastic. 
We will be back next time for dinner."

Took the leftover deserts home, but he didn't package the dipping sauces."
Iq3v95gHF9Exx2KsZ87Uaw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,Great for lunch. Nice atmosphere and the food was delicious. The prices are very fair and it's better to go during the week.
hgmyxdT9S4QwzFjBxrCUxQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"This sweet, atmospheric, popular little restaurant in Peachtree Battle is a lovely place to spend an evening. The wait wasn't terrible for a Friday night. We were seated at a table for two within 15-20 minutes. 
The bread came quickly and it wasn't bad. A nice crust but soft and mushy inside. Plain EVOO is on the table, as is a bottle of S. Pellegrino, for your convenience. 
Soft drinks are so loaded with ice that the server was run off his feet refilling our glasses. 
The home made chips are just plain awful. Salt and grease. Enough said. 
My lasagna was fine. The kind of fine that means mediocre. And it was lukewarm. I like OMG-I've-burned -my-mouth food temps. 
It was a pleasant experience in the way one may be pleasantly surprised that a trip to the dentist wasn't so bad."
yap2oKfyZqH18jI7nb6Ivg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,I visited aragosta for the first time this evening for restaurant week. It was a last minute choice for we didn't arrive at the restaurant until past 10pm. I had spoken to a host that was extremely pleasant and said we could certainly be accommodated. Upon arrival he informed us that the kitchen technically closes at 10 but they would be so kind as to take us (very nice of them). We chose to sit at the bar aside the open kitchen so our food was prepared right before us. Everything was delicious I had the swordfish and my boyfriend had the chicken. The main chef Ralph was impressively informative about our dishes. Our server was an older man and very very attentive. I have a great appreciation for this restaurant not only for their delicious cuisine but also for their accommodations for a late party entering at closing time. I will most certainly return!
id4JO_iE1JrczQ9b3POWjg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Definitely a new go to for date night. Nice ambience, quiet, friendly wait staff, and very accommodating. The executive chef made me lunch at 8:30am on a Sunday. All I have to say about the matter is ""Wow""! All the wait staff I met spoke Italian. This is the real authentic Italian bistro in Winter Park in my opinion. I had a well portioned Spaghetti Al Carbonara which was magnificent. Crispy Pancetta and the right amount of cream. I was thoroughly impressed with the Decor. I am a water snob and the delivered with San Benedetto. Pasquale was very personable and made me feel welcomed. I will definitely be a regular here."

It is very near Cheyenne Grill, so my only advice would be to go on a night that isn't going to be impacted by a big college football game"
-0MVFnrPglTOnNv1zNyspQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I went there for dinner a few times, love the ""aragosta"" wine, the best wine for Italian food. The lobster gnocchi is awesome! The flat breads are great,  all the seafood items on the menu is good. (I have tried almost every item on the menu)  The restaurant is by the water, you could see the beautiful night view if you sit by the water.

lF_-8iOYE7u4IG25BBP-Wg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I wrote a review earlier about this place after dinner with some friends, but we came back on a Gilt City for a clambake.  Despite being a Bostonian for 2 years, whatever the hell a clambake was still a huge mystery.  We sat outside and the patio was  gorgeous.  The problem is, while the food is good, it's nothing terribly creative and for a spot that's attached to the Fairmont Hotel, you'd just expect something a little more noteworthy.  The lobster was fine, the mussels and clams were tasty but weren't in a particularly noteworthy broth, and despite the pieces of chorizo sausage thrown in, it wasn't the kind of meal that you'd remember later.  The view was pretty sick ... that I'd remember.  But that pretty little lobster face and its accompanying broth?  Nada.  

Good place for a drink, for a nice view, for some people watching, for some appetizers, but you're not going to get a kick-ass Fairmont Hotel quality meal here."
QfBiHiKFDUSyeYITTta5KQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Make sure you have plenty of time!  If you have a reservation on a Tuesday night, be sure to make it for at least 20 minutes prior to when you'd like to be seated.  

Additionally, allow for at least an hour and a half for your food, even if you only order two pasta dishes, which we all know how challenging those can be when there are 3 other tables in the restaurant.  

And being a Tuesday, running out of appetizers when you have about 7 on the menu? Give me a break.  Food was mediocre and way over priced, terrible value."

I planned a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend with his best friends from college, and had to change venues last minute for a not-important reason. So I thought of Pasta Vino, as my requirements were laid back, not expensive, easy to get to, and cute. 

Unlike my usual organized self, I left logistics for the last minute-- how to make reservations at a restaurant that didn't take them? How to get a cake and have them bring it out? how to let the waiter know it was a birthday? Soo...I decided to drive down from Lenox earlier that very day to try and sort these things out.

Well I ended up running into the restaurant manager (wish I knew his name!) as I was walking into the door-- I explained that I was there to try to make reservations for a surprise party, etc etc. They were so accomodating and understanding, they even took the cake and candles I had just bought at the Publix next door to stick in their fridge for a few hours until we were ready for it!

Dinner ended up working out perfectly. Our waiter was super friendly and nice, the chef sent over an antipesto selection as an appetizer, which was more than generous. Dinner was great as usual, with wine, and then they brought out the cake with all candles blazing, and the whole restaurant sang and clapped!! It was adorable. My boyfriend was so surprised and happy...it was worth all the trouble and I was so grateful to Pasta Vino for playing along! Great experience."

I love that there was the engagement with the restaurant via FourSquare. That was a great start to the evening. However, we arrived for 7:15 and did not get our food for an hour. It was not that busy that it warranted so much waited time. Only right before the food came out was that addressed. 

Nevertheless, the food was good and the atmosphere great. We had wanted to make s'mores but you had to reserve a fire pit instead of an actual table. Noted for the future. The only thing that was frustrating was we asked at the beginning and end of dinner if there was availability for a fire pit table and they said they were reserved. Over the course of a two hour period, there was at least one that was always open. I wish they would've at least given us a time frame for the reservation because clearly they missed on further purchases from us due to this fact."

All I can say is REALLY? There was one lobster (a chicken at that) and a few clams and mussels - the clams were full of sand. No potatoes in 2 of the dishes but our waiter was nice enough to get us a few when we pointed it out. The cornbread was actually black it was so burnt. My guess is they served what should have been an individual portion to each couple. Even at the reduced price ($45 per couple for what they claim they charge $70 for) it was a rip off. We walked over to Ernesto's for pizza when we were done because we were still hungry. The host and waitstaff were very nice and accommodating, but this was a huge missed opportunity for them to impress us. I wouldn't go back."

If you love smores and fondue, come here! 
I came here with my best friend on my birthday and the service and experience was great! It was a great space to talk and hangout. Make sure you have a reservation though! Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait a bit for our pit.

We got two sampler plates. I think the first one was the Battery sampler. The  sampler  included bread, cheese, meat, dried apricots, dried figs, strawberries and little red peppers. The cheese fondue that came out with it was kind of small for the amount of food on the sampler plate.There was a lot of food on that plate! Definitely could be shared among 4 people if you are planning to get other foods. Everything on the plate was fresh and tasted great. We were here around dinner time, so we asked the waiter if we should order something else from the menu. He said we should have plenty of food from the sampler and the smores plate we were going to get. He said if we were hungry after the sampler plate, he would pay for the appetizer! Very bold statement there..so we thought he was joking. After we finished the sampler plate, we weren't necessarily super hungry, but there were so many appetizers that sounded tasty so we decided to order the lobster ravioli, which was very yummy!  When the bill came, we were surprised that the appetizer was not on the bill! Our waiter was super sweet and attentive :] 

The Smores plate was perfect. It came with plenty of graham cracker, marshmallows and Hershey's chocolate. It also came with sliced bananas and Reeses peanut butter cups! It was the just perfect! It was an elegant smores experience :]"

tH351tW6uBrGbTJGRFXh-w,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,2,"Went to Al Bacio on Sunday for breakfast with my family. Walked in and was offered to partake in their $20 breakfast buffet, which came with unlimited food from the buffet, as well as unlimited mimosas, bellinis, and sangria. Someone in my party ordered that, only to find out that all the food in the buffet was cold. Someone else in my party ordered the American Breakfast, in which the pancakes that came out were also cold... For the prices we paid, we weren't impressed. Lattes are good though, but not good enough for us to come back and eat COLD omelettes and pancakes."

JIOQa-as5aYCX0N-fMvalQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"This cute little restaurant is located at the further end of park avenue! I came here for a yelp event and it truly did not disappoint. The staff was amazing and you can really tell how much passion they have in making these authentic dishes adding their own taste to it. Starting off with the drinks, the sangria was AMAZING and so refreshing especially with real pieces of fruit inside the drink. We were able to try 3 different variety of pastas: gnocchi, pesto, and lasagna. All of them were of course delicious with such strong fresh flavors. My favorite had to be the gnocchi, I was never a fan before but i was pleasantly surprised of how good they made the gnocchi and sauce that paired with it. Everything is home made here and you can really see the pay off in the food from having it made the same day. To end your meal they also have a variety of desserts on display as well. When I am back in the area and have an Italian craving, I will be stopping by again!"

Great for business and pleasure. Highly recommended!"
SXj5p8Q_Z-oZPxF1zRE72A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"I met my sister and niece here for dinner on 8/16. I was early, so I sat at the bar and was warmly greeted by Patrick the bartender. Super friendly, kind and engaging. He made me feel right at home. He also was extremely helpful answering my questions  about the specialty drink menu. Patrick made me a great drink too! Definitely a fantastic bartender and I can say that because I've been a bartender all my life. I also know about food, especially hotel food, working at many hotels around Boston since '78. So that was the great... here's the bad, the really bad! The food was horrible. The service was sadly slow with over a 40 minute wait between each courses. More effort was put into the presentation than the food itself. Our Appetizers were the $13 ""pee wee""Lump Crab Bites that tasted more like frozen fish cakes with a clump of greasy sauteed green peppers on the plate and a $14 ""bland""Lobster Cavatappi that had no rapini (of which was misspelled on the menu) and was a soupy mix of overcooked pasta, bits of bacon and no leeks that I could see or even taste. Our Entrees: I chose the $28 Georges Banks Scallops, dry and cold, served with cold overcooked farro primavera that was simply inedible. My niece chose the $29 Cast Iron Rib Eye Steak Tips swimming in grease with duck fat truffle fries, without the truffle! My sister chose one of the evening specials $32, which I did not taste. My sister claimed her dish was cold as well. The dish looked as if it hung out under the heating lamp for quite some time and the asparagus was described as being pre cooked and heated to serve. YUCK!  We did not complain, we were late for our concert and had to rush. I did happen to see the Patrick the bartender on the way out and he graciously asked me how our meal was. I was honest and told him, not good at all. If I remember right I believe he said the restaurant had been without a Chef and they were in the process of hiring a new Chef. The restaurant manager had made out the menu and was overseeing the kitchen. Boy does that explain things. A VERY expensive meal for a VERY disappointing experience.  Also, when I went back and read the website it still had Chef Joseph Adamo as ""Meet Our Chefs""but when I called the hotel concierge later in the week, Dave said Chef Adamo was still there. Beautiful venue, icky food."
y9FJeQa3ACIVFM53g8cCpg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Just in case, and it seems highly unlikely, the people who took me here happen on this review let me start by saying my overall experience was 5 stars!  With that covered...I found the dining experience to be just average and would give 2.5 stars if I could but am giving as opposed to removing the extra half because my take is based on one visit and the service was good.  Although the outdoor seating is nice the restuarant itself lives up to what one would expect to find in a strip mall.  It's very much ho hum decor is matched by a menu that covers some ground but lacks imagination.  And, based on my dinner, when they do try something it does not always work.  I had a gnocchi special with shrimp, kalamata olives, capers, and perhaps one other ingredient.  It was watery and in general lacked much flavor.  I also tasted the Rigatoni Napoletana which was nothing special and included what seemed to be processed sausage, and the Veal Piccata which was tasty but absolutely swimming in butter.

My guess is that if I lived in the area this could become an 'if nothing else comes to mind' fall back restaurant option but I would definitely not rush back.  I'm sure for the money, it pushes $$$, there are better options around."
OcMMHvMdXMf0zGtdN-IpQQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"This place is all right. Technically this is a 2.5 star review, but I'm going to round up because of the fries.

The atmosphere is nice, we sat outside and it was a lovely night. View seekers, you will not be disappointed, because it's right on the waterfront. The service was pretty attentive and our dishes came in a reasonable amount of time. We were given a complimentary antipasto plate to share amongst the table and that was a pleasant surprise.

I ordered the herb-roasted chicken with polenta, and after a thorough salt and peppering it was much better -- does no one season their food any more? The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. I also got a side of the fries, which were absolute heaven. They're fried in duck fat and come with a side of aioli, so they're not for the faint of heart. There was a generous portion of them and I barely made a dent, but honestly they were perfection. 

The major drawbacks were alcohol-related, being that our waiter did not know how to properly pour a beer (they bring the glass and bottle to the table and do it for you), all of our glasses had about 2 inches of foam. The other was the wine pour: for $9, you get two ounces of wine. Words cannot explain my dismay. Quite beyond the pale.

So while the food is overall very decent, the alcohol is not. And that's an important part of a dining experience in my book. So maybe i'll come back for the food and have drinks elsewhere."
1e_p00sydBxtQDnIvDDNsA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Getting a reservation here was a hassle - we had to call about five times to get anyone on the line. 

When we arrived, nobody was available at the hostess stand. After waiting for someone to appear for 10+ minutes, we had to wander into the restaurant and ask at the bar if they knew where the hostess was. 

Food here was decent (although definitely not good enough to justify high prices) but the only reason we chose Aragosta was the advertised all-day brunch, which does not exist. Our visit was in early August - it is now November and they are still advertising the all-day brunch that doesn't exist."

The food is truly fantastic and the menu has lots to choose from!!"

No way for me to pick a favorite, too many. The garlic knot rolls are to die for DROOL...  We have been fans for over 10 years which started when we lived OTP and went to the original Pasta Vino in Duluth."

uq7N-HAIyV_jvukN8dlzFA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Wow this restaurant inThe Battery Wharf Hotel is seriously lacking. We sat for maybe 15 minutes after we'd ordered without water or coffee, which as it turns out are one in the same here - blech. How hard is it to make a cup of coffee? We also tried a latte - hilarious that they have audacity to call it such - more brown water with watery froth - really - so, so bad. Both ""coffees"" tasted like the grounds were being used for third or fourth time. All in all breakfast took about an hour - we'd have been better off without it. The waitress went to great pains to avoid eye contact with anyone - to be fair this place was grossly understaffed. And the food is not good. Pass."

Lunch was fabulous, reasonably priced and well-served. We will be back again based on this experience, and the breakfast coffee and dinner reviews here. 

This part of Park Ave. doesn't get the high traffic of the rest of the Ave does. So next time go out of your way and stop in for lunch. You'll want to come back again, too."

gbBW1G9fA78yDVymh4EbWw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"OpenTable recently had a list of the top 10 outdoor dining experience in Boston. So, granted, the day we  went it was totally pouring... But, aside from the view, its still a restaurant first, yes?  We had big expectations and the place was a bit of a bummer. The food was just okay. We ordered the mussels for the appetiser (unshelled in a modestly flavourful broth and the portion sizes were definitely NOT for sharing), the Ahi Tuna flatbread (which was actually really tasty, and generous portions of fish).  Dinner was the scallops (really iffy barley on the side; you can't just douse something with balsamic vinaigrette to make it taste better... What is with restaurants that use balsamic vinaigrette for EVERYTHING?  They sell that stuff at convenience stores nowadays. It's NOT a unique taste anymore!).  Also for entrees we had the linguine (which seemed good by linguine standards), and the cannelloni (which was meaty, and good... But very rich).  

For a restaurant that purports itself as fine dining, the waitress hardly had any recommendations, the portion sizes were small, and the food just wasn't outstanding. Further, the food took a really long time to come out and they forgot stuff we ordered.  It's one thing if the place is very busy, but it was EMPTY and there was at least 1 wait staff to 1 customer.  Again, just seemed a bit unexpected for that caliber of restaurant.  The prices also where high and collectively, that's a combo that doesn't work for most people. 

If we ever come here again, it will exclusively be to look out at the water, hear the jazz band out in the lobby, and hope we just has a fluke experience with the place tonight.  Not the hottest choice, especially in such a hip part of town as the North End with options galore."
j_nslJRMkiB3ytCKAuvQog,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I have been to Aragosta now on four separate occasions, and am glad to have such a wonderful spot in the north end neighborhood. 

My first time here was for some drinks and apps on their patio this past summer. We had a nice, relaxing time and were even privy to have a beautiful firework show on the water. The drinks were good, but the zeppoles for desert were my favorite. 

The next time I was here was for a neighborhood fundraiser (RUFF) and it was wonderful. The lounge it was held in was beautiful. Perfect space for this event and it was even complete with a Jazz band playing that evening. The waiter for the event was a bit of grump though... 

My husband and I were impressed with the menu and came back for dinner soon after. I started with the lobster popover - which was supposed to only be available in the lounge, but they made an exception as this is why I went there that evening. It was good - not as great as I expected though. It had a bit too much of sauce in it for my taste. For dinner I had the Herb Roasted Organic Chicken with Exotic Mushroom Polenta, and Broccoli Rabe. It was amazing! The chicken was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The polenta was creamy with just the right amount of mushrooms - I am a hard critic on polenta.. I have never like polenta outside of the kind my Italian family makes.  For desert - you guessed it those delish zeppoles. Our waiter was great, as he convinced them to make an exception for the lobster popover - I will remember next time that they have separate menus:) 

Most recently I was there for the north end library fundraiser and had a great time. The hors d'oeuvres were great and the space downstairs was fantastic. The bartenders were not a friendly as I would have hoped - but they were efficient and got us our drinks. 

One thing I did notice is that the decor in the restaurant does not match the classiness of the lounge or patio. The decor reminds me something of the dining room of a cruise ship... but this can be overlooked for great food and drinks. 

I am looking forward to trying out smores on their patio sometime soon around a fire pit! Thanks for being a great spot in our neighborhood!"
KGPEP8wH3N1UitvyFZ7YFQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,"We had dinner here on New Year's Eve and it couldn't have been better!  The atmosphere was perfect: a nice blend of small neighborhood restaurant friendliness, festive holiday time and even romance.  The food was delicious.  Great fresh ceasar salad.  I have veal pamesan which as great.  The marinara is awesome.  My husband had the special which as Lamb and it was perfectly seasoned.  The bread was wonderful too."
4AnoHsF-wtcrBQYr3GdbCg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"food very nice ... great time of year to sit outside and dine on park ave .. you would think with the amount of reviews and talk on the street they would just get their service up to standard .. if there are 4 employees out front and three tables ..stop by the tables ..and if ordering a second glass of wine , realize it is best to bring it prior to completion of meal especially when ordered several bites in ..
but , did I say very nice food '
yes !"
UIGSxX3pov4qTAt_ub7zCQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"We went to Aragosta on a recent Sunday afternoon to use a ""champagne and oysters"" certificate from Gilt that was about to expire.  We were quite unsure what to expect; we'd been to another Gilt-sponsored event here when the weather was warmer and it was the kind of experience that one could imagine being lovely...if they had ordered enough food, provided enough staff, and hadn't sold so many tickets that the place felt like a Ramones show at the old Channel, circa 1979 (yeah, I'm THAT old...).
Thankfully, our experience this time was an order of magnitude nicer and more civilized.  We sat at the chef's table, watched our Wellfleet oysters get shucked, our fresh squid get battered and fried, and our glasses stay full from the bottle of ""good-enough"" Prosecco supplied as part of the Gilt deal.  We would have left after that feeling pretty okay with the experience, but Theo, the chef working that day, decided to make a reasonably nice experience a really lovely experience.  We talked with him a bit about his background and his passion for food came through in a way that made two aging foodies smile.  He gave us some duck prosciutto to try and some New England-sourced goat cheese, too.  We left happier than when we went in.  We called the day a success...
We look forward to trying the full menu next time....and we hope that experience is as good as this last one was."

84Nxv5jUcR4xqQ7mcaN8CA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Visited on a Wednesday night. Not crowded at all. Cool, quite vibe.  Intimate restaurant accessible through the lobby of the Battery Wharf Hotel.

Seated immediately and Paul was my server.  Very nice guy. Great service. Knowledgeable about the area and the menu. 

Instead of an entree, I opted to do a sampling of small plates. Crab cakes, Calamari, Truffle Fries. 

Crab Cakes - Great quality. Fresh and price appropriate. Good size. Larger than average I would say. 

Calamari - I love Calamari, but this didn't really appeal to me. Something about the breading. Cracked Black pepper was a good addition. Think I would have preferred them more crispy. They are however, served over an amazing remoulade with a touch of spice.

Truffle Fries - Great basket of Fries.  Can be eaten alone.  No ketchup. The shaved parmesan really sets it off. 

It was freezing out, but they have a small fire pit. Also a bar with 3-4 TV's. I will definitely be back to sample an entree."
DEknhpvJ9Md_EYcr75n5tQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,"Usually when I dislike a restaurant's food, the service may make up for it, Or vice versa. In Pasta Vino's case, they struck out with both. 

I'll keep this in list form for simplicity and brevity.

- Upon entering, we were completely ignored by the girl manning the register. No hostess?
- We were eventually given two glasses of water for the four of us, with a promise of two more glasses to come. We waited and waited... and finally had to catch his eye before he remembered us.
- Bread basket contained rolls that were over-baked and too hard on the outside.
- Calamari was completely tasteless and pale in color.
- I ordered linguine with clams. I received 12 fresh clams, all right, on top of fettucine. Not linguine. It was extremely bland.
- BF got smoked salmon alfredo. It was linguine (don't alfredos use fettucine? Maybe they mixed up our pastas) completely smothered in this rich (and not in a good way) sauce. The smoked salmon was INCREDIBLY salty. So of course, that made the entire dish a salty, creamy mess.
- Neither of our two tablemates were happy with their dishes either. One got a chicken breast on top of greens. He commented that his salad was incredibly oily and the leaves were wilted due to the hot pieces of chicken being placed directly on top of the salad. The other had Mediterranean gnocchi and commented it was also bland and very starchy.
- They do not allow separate checks. When we attempted to pay with separate cards anyway, our server asked us to go up to the register to ""ensure that everything gets split up correctly."" Really? Three cards too much to handle?

On top of it, we were treated to a show of rambunctious kids running around, yelling their faces off. Their parents were dining at the restaurant next to us. This has nothing to do with PV of course, but only added to our already bad dining experience."
EKysyYGr910MmfIBNDWG8Q,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Four stars for a pretty decent hidden gem in Winter Park. I was in the mood for Italian this week and with Yelp restaurant week offering 30% off the check, my friends and I decided to give it a shot. Pretty decent and the atmosphere is casual with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have beer and wine only and I decided not to drink tonight but there is an ample amount of options available if you do drink. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal from seafood dishes to pasta to the 4- Cheese white pizza that I tried. It is pretty filling although it's a thin crust pizza so don't let it fool you. I ended up taking half home for lunch tomorrow. I definitely would return although service was a bit slow."
KPSFG6MsES-OzkE_OGyraA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,1,"Extremely dissatisfied with the service and the food; we waited a long time for a table and then for the waitress who was rude. The food portions were small. They gave us a happy hour menu and then overcharged us with regular prices, and added an automatic tip - when the waitress adjusted the bill, she put it as a discount instead of correcting the price, and the tip remained 20% of the incorrect total so she got extra, unearned and undeserved tip."
gSV9Tl7wgPNux6B2tTOLVw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"We were looking forward to visiting this brand new restaurant on the water. 
We arrived ten minutes late for our reservation and were prompted to sit at the bar for 5-10 minutes. Fine. After twenty minutes and ten minutes just to get a beer and scotch, we had to flag down the hostess to get our table in which she responded, ""oh you want to eat now?"" Really?? 
We were seated and ordered two pasta dishes. Both delicious but extremely small. We were starving and had to order more bread.
The decor needs some updating, looks very 80s contemporary in a hotel. 
The worst part is that we had printed a 20% off coupon from their facebook page. We were walking out the door and realized we had forgotten to give the coupon. We went back inside and asked if it was possible for us to get a refund on our credit card for the 20% and they said they had closed the check. It was clearly not possible for them to put 20% back on our card and they gave us another coupon. I don't think we'll be back here and I don't recommend it. 
Service was friendly enough but no one ever checked on us."

Try to get there early though because the outside closes at 10. The s'mores comes with graham crackers, peanut butter cups, Hershey chocolates and marshmallows. It was amazing and they gave so much.

IzbumUDYKN-5fCC2e-nayw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"So glad I was able to host a UYE here for Yelp's Restaurant Week.  Al Bacio is right on Park Avenue, but is towards the end that does not have a lot of foot traffic.  Hopefully this place will get the attention it deserves, because it's fantastic!

Unfortunately, I was unable to reach the restaurant to make a reservation, so I showed up 15 minutes early hoping for a table for 15 people for a 6:30 dinner on a weekday.  Luckily, the server was extremely helpful and was able to set me up a table right away.  Slowly my party started to arrive.

Speaking of slow, my only gripe about this place was that service was a bit slow in getting drinks, etc.  However, we were a surprise large group and there were only 2 servers working at the time.  So I won't count it against them.  Out server was very nice, made recommendations to anyone that asked, and always made sure our waters were filled.

The menu has so many amazing options on it.  I had a very hard time deciding what I was going to eat.  I ultimately decided on a side caesar salad and the carbonara with parpadelle pasta, which was recommended by my waiter as the parpadelle would soak up all of the sauce and really make the dish.  Everyone at the table got something different and it was fun to see everything come out, as all of the dishes were presented beautifully.  

My caesar salad was very simple, but good.  I thought the dressing was tasty, however I tend to enjoy the creamy caesar dressing rather than the oil based that on the salad, but that's just preference.  My carbonara pasta was great!  The noodles seemed to be homemade, definitely soaked up the delicious rich sauce, and the pancetta was crispy and offered a wonderful smoky taste to the dish.  I had the privilege of trying my friend's dish next to me, which was the parpadelle that had a white wine cream sauce, asparagus, and italian sausage.  I actually enjoyed that one more than mine, but they are two completely different dishes so it's hard to say one is better than the other in that sense.  

We didn't have dessert, but I did see that some was offered.  They also have plenty of coffee drinks as well, which would be wonderful paired with a dessert.  I will definitely come back here to try the other dishes that were on my list to have, and would recommend Al Bacio to anyone!"
CGmVUMCTPZC1Yb-cO_tOXg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,First time to this place on park ave.  We had the risotto with shrimp and gnocchi.   The portions were just right with quick service.  The flavor was fresh with just the right spices.

I felt like I was a vampire from having a blood soaked bun. The fries that came with it could have been better. They normally have more truffle taste but apparently skimped out tonight. 

Disregarding the undercooked (somewhat raw) meat and blood factor, they still have the best kobe burger in town. They mix caper and dijon into their meat, just enough so that it is not overwhelming. I'll be smarter next time to not eat a burger at the sofa - I had to put a side plate on my lap so I didn't make a mess on myself."

We tried their mussels (not bad), fried calamari (fried tough), lobster ravioli (poor) and their veal parm (beyond awful).  We had two bites of the calamari and I took two bites of the veal parm (The second bite was just checking to see if the first bite was really as awful as I thought-it was).  Most of the food was left on the table.  No one noticed.  I guess if there is no place else to eat you could try this place but I can't imagine ever going there again."

Our second visit was even better than the first. We recru excellent service from Trevor and the rest of the staff. My friends and I enjoyed many of the same dishes as our first visit. For an appetizer, we tried the spinach and artichoke dip. Wow! Sooo good. For our entrees, we exchanged the pizza for their amazing risotto with shrimp and steak and a side of mixed veggies (so fresh and delicious). 

We ate family-style and shared everything again. This gave us all an opportunity to have a little bit of everything.

This restaurant is such a vibe. We love it!

My friend found this restaurant through Groupon. We were looking for some place to bring our mutual friend to celebrate her birthday. I was asked to check it out and immediately came to Yelp to read the reviews. Since they were mostly positive, I agreed to Al Bacio.

Best. Decision. Ever.

The restaurant is quaint and has a very nice vibe. Relaxing. It's on the part of Park Ave that is not as congested and busy. Perfect! 

The staff was great and very accommodating. I saw some reviews from some who felt they were not treated well due to using a Groupon. That was not our group's experience at all. The staff were all very responsive and even pitched in to assist when our server was occupied with her other customers.

As for the food...I'm still drooling. We each ordered something different so that we could share. We had seen so many delicious looking dishes being served to other customers that we couldn't make up our minds. It worked out perfectly! Every dish we tried was delicious and we definitely plan on visiting this restaurant again. Next time we plan to take advantage of their outdoor seating. I can hardly wait.."
2CeYcR0K_XKcLNh7v8NZwA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Excellent place to brunch on a warm summer day with views of the harbor. Yogurt parfait was very tasty and beautiful to look at, decorated with granola and an assortment of summer berries and mint. I enjoyed the coast guard (lobster) omelet as well. Service was very good, but the environment is the winner here. It's part of a hotel, which gives you the luxury of walking through the hotel lobby with jazz playing in the background and access to spacious hotel bathrooms. The patio area and indoors are both lovely. This is a classy place to take someone if you're looking to impress, maybe in-laws or a potential client?"
IXECnqMiqXrFlImu8py05g,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,2,"Went for breakfast and hated it. The place is cute, but the food is horrible. They don't even use real eggs for their omelets!"
6X-R5VwDyjfCxpXC4PFBiw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"So if you want great Italian food and a nice atmosphere, you must try Pasta Vino in Buckhead. We have been there several times and go back. Food is delicious and served pretty. The staff is always asking if we need anything and they are very knowledgeable of what you order with out a tablet to take it. It is also a romantic place for my husband and I to have a pleasant dinner together. And if you have children it is great also. Must try."
LfSbn011h0JNLO-GYpw_VA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"THE BEST Italian food we've had in the United States!!! Very reminiscent of restaurants in Europe. We shared the Al Bacio pizza as an appetizer. It was light, thin and flavorful.  I had Parpadelle pasta with Napoli sauce, which was nothing short of amazing. My husband had the Carbonara, which was nice and creamy, but without the heavy creams some restaurants use to create the same effect. Delicious! The staff were friendly, and service was relatively prompt for food freshly cooked. A gem in Winter Park. We live about an hour away and will definitely come back."
UrXg3KkSaWvK70P_UItQOQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Why do you advertise an all day brunch on your website and Yelp if you don't actually have an all day brunch? The menu ended up having about 8 items. Very disappointing.

We ended up ordering the garlic shrimp and the sliders. The garlic shrimp tasted fine, but consisted of five shrimp for $13. The sliders were warm, not hot.

Service was incredibly slow despite there being only four other patrons in the whole restaurant.

This place feels very isolated and forgotten. What a shame. We live in the neighborhood and we were hoping to enjoy a place within walking distance that had a nice view of the water. Alas, this isn't that place. We won't be coming back."
O1FcPHlhxvLUPg-UTj2tNg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,Very relaxing environment with friendly staff. Menu is extensive with plenty of appealing choices. Don't leave here without grabbing one of their delicious deserts!
LnY1vsB4UDiZ5FaJJ4hyjw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,5,I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It's a cozy spot that's easy to miss.  I ordered the apple and goat cheese ravioli which was absolutely amazing!! It was the reason I wanted to try Pasta Vino.  The waiter was also great. He gave us free garlic knots in addition to first helping of bread and garlic knots he had given.  I am definitely going back!
ULWAgBA0v59TPj7vgB4vNQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"Everything about last night was perfect!  It started with a table for 2 right by the water.  Our server, Colleen, was very prompt, friendly and made some very good recommendations.  We were there for restaurant week, but they offered virtually every item on their full menu, but some had a slight up charge.  My starting cocktail was the Basil Lemondrop, and it completely won me over.  I am VERY picky about my foo foo martinis, but this one was outstanding.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was excellent.  My secondi was the halibut, which was cooked to perfection.  I have absolutely nothing negative at all to say...oh, and the bathrooms were amazing!"
VE2djbIC3cXktGxk4Smhow,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"Chef David D. is The Man, the menu is brimming with unique and inspired dishes at fair market value. Heres some of my favorite items.

Breakfast: Coast guard omelet is perfect if you want a nourishing but lighter breakfast, if really hungry and want the goods go for the turkey hash , very rich.

Lunch: The tuna flat bread pizza is culinary genius. Great lobster rolls too! Yes,  lobster on Brioche works out great.

Dinner : The lobster crostini, bite sized delights that i could devour ad infinitum. 
The roasted chicken with mushrooms was heavenly.

The Goods:
Everything is fresh, which is all I truly care about.
Overall aesthetics such at the patio and the bar which is inset with tigers-eye, well done whoever chose that. The bar stools are surprising comfortable considering their remarkably simple design.

The Bads:
Bathroom located in an alternate dimension
Post-modern art on the walls

The breakdown
 Very Good food, friendly staff, decent scotch selection, A+++"
-8IA90KR7UyEedYvR4-qTA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"The only thing this place has going for it is location!  Bad service, decent food, horrible music for an Italian restaurant....   I would love a decent dining venue in Peachtree Battle Shopping Center!"
q_qBeyID_LeWi47Wtt18FA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Al Bacio is a cozy Italian cafe, located on the quieter end of Park Avenue. From the Lavazza espresso to the Italian accents and radio...it definitely pulls you out of the States and into a casual cafe on the streets of Venice. 

I ordered the Al Bacio Espresso and Al Bacio breakfast. (I have a thing for sticking to the brand names if you didn't already know). The espresso was so good! Sugary but delicious! 

The breakfast was really good...and felt like a very well-balanced meal! I'll add more to this when I go back. So yummy! :-D"
5LO7LdWk-7kq3jKqxfVtXg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,The Snapper Pompadoro was exceptional. The Margarita pizza was great. The only reason we didn't give them 5 stars is that they included an automatic 20% tip on the bill even though there were only two of us. I don't mind tipping 20% for exceptional food and service but I like to make that decision myself. I would still very much recommend this restaurant!
ApQ-39RIvLWgXdIGNu3LFQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,The menu is limited and unexciting. The food was very salty as well. The location is great but again the menu lacks pizzaz!
h2CVy2Sf4WOU4zzp-crFcw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"The service here is extremely slow. I went at a time where there were only three other parties dining and the servers are just not attentive. 

The food is terrible. Bruschetta is essentially store bought tomato sauce in a bowl and you put it on the bread. The Caesar salad was drenched in too much dressing and the pasta was flavorless. 

The only reason this place gets a 2 is because he bread was good and price is reasonable, but that's not enough to bring me back."
FYhY0je7s6Ngc9alFNYSRQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for a late brunch.  The space is really large inside and has a pretty cool vibe.  We were seated on the patio and had a great view of the harbor and Coast Guard cutters.  Patio was not that busy.  Our server was friendly, but as we were one of her only outside tables she wasn't as attentive as she might have been had she been more busy.  (This isn't an issue for me, I hate when servers are overbearing)

Started with the warm olives from the bar menu and the bread.  Ah, the bread.  Luckily I did a lot of walking that day so I didn't feel guilty eating most of it.

I ordered the kobe burger with the fries and the salad.  Burger was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Salad was very good, although a bit overdressed.  Fries were pretty good as well.  My date ordered the mushroom omelet, thought it was good and also liked the salad.

Drinks were good, and check was reasonable.  We expected it to be a bit more than it was.  Would definitely like to check this place out for dinner and the jazz night.  If you're looking for something on the water that's a little more off the beaten path, this is a great spot to check out."
mkPdoV2b-w10LyX-FYzQyw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"Love the service, food, and wine! 

Try going on TravelZoo for some of their discounted deals occasionally for their lobster bake or oyster and wine!"
pKMCiDN60DNBILmuN_0JQA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Consistently outstanding !  We walked north on Park Avenue past a long line of people waiting to get into the briarpatch....why?  Get out of that line and go to al bacio for an excellent breakfast with lots of choices, delicious food and friendly, attentive service!  Or don't, so we can keep this treasure to ourselves!  This is the real deal!   Good selection of delicious coffees and entrees!  Enjoy!"
Rh5DqoYnJdKeelkCZ5fHlw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Food was good but the waitress was not aware what Chianti was, brought us incorrect drinks, made it difficult to order and basically was very uneducated in the restaurant she worked in. Normally, I could care less but the bad service just never ended - 4/10. 

The food was excellent 9/10. On my weighted average scale of criteria, that's why they get 4 - food, decor and atmosphere trumps all other issues. The decor was decent 7/10 and the atmosphere was very nice with live music 8/10. 

I'd go back. I just hope the waitress gains a bit more experience."
v_ryN9Z2GJEyugrcmPcRgw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"We dined here for the first time this past Friday night. With the weather being beautiful, we asked to sit outside on the romantic patio overlooking the harbor. 

The manager came out to serve us the bottle of wine we ordered and in the process we inquired about the salt and vinegar fries on the menu. We ended up not ordering them because we weren't that hungry, but he found out and sent them out to us anyway. An unexpected and appreciated treat. 

The atmosphere & service get a 9/10 and the food probably an 7.5/10. We split a caesar salad, the rigatoni bolognese, and the lamb meatballs. 

Definitely recommend this place for a great date night by the water."
mUtVtCdf5dTvnR5qXpnRSg,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Everything about this place is amazing! We came on a whim yesterday morning for brunch and it was a bit busy but we were attended to promptly and didn't feel rushed. Our server Daniel was extremely friendly but not overbearing. We sat outside on the couches and it was so nice on the ave and the food made it so much better! We had the spinach and artichoke appetizer with the bruschetta, and a chicken parmigiana, and the carbonara. Also, the Italian sodas were great too. Really happy we gave this place a shot, will definitely be back!"
UA1Finw9UB4CO6BPkdbPBQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Wonderful addition to the north end of Park Avenue!  My first meal was lunch, so far.  The Il Prato panini was delicious, to say the least.  Fresh, clean, good food; even the sweet potato chips were crisp and tasty, not greasy, like so many other places there. 
The dessert cases look like a picture - everything is so enticing and beautiful to look at.  We tried the Chocolate Malaga and a Triple Chocolate and they were addicting!!  AND - a nice little portion - just enough to finish a delightful lunch.  Friendly personnel who are eager to please.  I honestly hope this place stays.  We need a great little place like AL Bacio!  I will refer AL Bacio to everyone I know who knows and cares about good food!  I just wish there were more place like this in other areas!!"
zL0SqBKHZPMM-UH5Xe2mIA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"All-around great little neighborhood Italian restaurant. The veal really surprises - it's always good, but often amazing. All the entrees are worth a go. They have the friendliest wait staff, sometime exceedingly efficient, sometimes lax. Obviously not all family, but the act as though they are. The staff hasn't turned-over much in the 10 years I've been going here.
They used to have the best NY-style pizza around, but anymore it's undercooked, poked full of holes like a saltine cracker and absolutely worth passing on.  Truly disappointing. I used to LOVE their pizza."
QdJ1h_BOTxSt_1tdJgedKQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,This is my new go to Italian in the neighborhood!  I had the chicken francese and my husband had the veal parm. Both were very good. The service was great and it was fairly priced. All in all a great place!
IOPT05xeuGnnbA-1UOerHw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Let me start by saying the food was good and had a creative component to it, but the service..... wow that was bad. If you (Aragosta) are not interested in serving food from the bar menu at happy hour just change your strategy. We had the burgers, lobster roll and Caesar salads, again all creative and tasty but the delivery process was incredibly slow and inattentive."
PW16xTBls6xaSufEL3CcUQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,3,"Customer service was really good!  However, I was not impressed with the food.  I am not saying it wasn't good, it was just ok.... And i was expecting more!

I asked for a veggie panini with fresh mozzarella thin sliced and melted.  Came in without being all melted. I didn't bother to return it, just took out the unmelted cheese.  I sat outside and that was very relaxing.  Mimosa was very good."
91etEmurHrlIB3r2iNi7dA,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Quaint little italian place with great food! I wasn't to crazy about the garlic bread but my margherita pizza was very good. My mother had the chicken parmesan and her's was fantastic! Best she has ever had. I will say both meals were very light, not over powering, and therefore you were able to enjoy the whole meal without feeling stuffed. Seasonal cheesecake was great as well! Loved the ambiance and very nice wait staff. We will be back for sure."
WTzycZQI7SZwvs5YG4mFXA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"I'm having trouble deciding on how many stars to give this rating... on the one hand, I would give high marks for atmosphere (we sat out on the terrace, at a fire pit table, on a gorgeous bright late summer/early autumn day) - it was so peaceful and beautiful, we hardly felt like we were in downtown Boston.  However, the food didn't really impress the way I thought it would.  This might be because I went there with my boyfriend for their ""Weekend Clambake"" specials, but I was using a voucher from Gilt City (like Groupon, for those who aren't familiar).  

I think we got ripped off, quite frankly.  The normal meal is supposed to be $35 a person - and they supposedly serve you a lobster, clams, mussels, potatoes, corn on the cob, and chorizo, plus cornbread and watermelon.  Seems reasonable, right?  With the voucher however, you are suckered into thinking you're getting a great deal because they sell you a ""clambake for two"" for a total price of $49.  This includes two Sam Adams summer beers.  What they *don't* tell you is that you actually only will be served a single portion of food that you have to share with your other dining companion.  True, you do each get your own beer, your own small triangle of watermelon, and your own tiny wedge of cornbread, but the main course is still just one plate with a lobster, a few clams and mussels, the equivalent of a half a corn cob,
and maybe three fingerling potatoes - that you both will have to share!?

So essentially, you are still paying 50 bucks for one small lobster and a few clams/mussels (I think there was a total of 9 or 10 between them).  This would be just enough to satisfy one person, but it was definitely not enough food for two people.  And definitely NOT worth $50.  Plus, we were expected to tip on what they tell you the total would have cost had you not used your voucher - they claim the entire meal would have been $70 (again remember we are talking ONE small lobster, and about 4 clams, 4-6 mussels, plus 2 fingerling potatoes).  TOTAL RIP OFF.

I don't know who is to blame for this - Aragosta, or Gilt City?  One of them was not being totally honest when they advertised this deal.  It was no deal at all...

The food that was being delivered to other tables definitely looked delicious, so I might still return - but I will definitely never purchase anything else from Gilt City in the future.  I've been totally burned by them too many times now."
r3_qr8eKGlu6__DHp2J9nw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,3,"Was expecting some decent food since all the the reviews are good. The service on a Saturday morning was VERY slow and the food tasteless. I did custom order a vegetarian dish but my husband ordered a sandwich off of the menu. Neither of us were impressed. The owner was out and about in the restaurant and the deserts looked good. However, those were the only positives. 

They get 3 stars instead of 2 because they were very apologetic and brought out nutella goodies for my kids."
l8nqMabc4MLSEQKjhpKT5Q,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"This is one of my favorite restaurants for good food and always a pleasant dining experience. I have brought so many friends here through the years who have never dined here and it is always a hit. Since the new owner took it over, things have only improved. The menu has something for everyone and I love the specials that they offer. My favorite is the beef short ribs over risotto and I keep hoping it will be back on the menu again soon. Atlanta could use more neighborhood restaurants of this calibre."
5tiRvDtEAOLN_wdWEuiVTQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Came here on a Sunday night at 5:30 pm with 6 of my friends from work. There was ample seating and we were able to dine outside on the terrace overlooking the water.

The ambience was pleasant -- it was a beautiful day out! But unfortunately, everything else was subpar. Our group agreed that the food was overpriced for the quality ($18-20 for mediocre sandwiches and $25-40 for entrees), and the drink menu limited (one of my friends went through a number of beer requests to find out they did not have them available). Food-wise their saving grace was their fries! Delish! However, they could not redeem the atrocious service -- it's been awhile since I've been at a place with poorer service. Our waitress was extremely slow despite there being only a few other patrons (one margarita came out 20 minutes after all the other drinks despite being ordered at the same time as the others). None of our water glasses were refilled at any point during our dinner despite being empty. When we asked for a refill, she acknowledged our request and never fulfilled it. She came out with our checks without us asking, with gratuity included (not surprising given the size of our party). We were all tired of the lazy service and took this as a queue. We left thirsty, $40 dollars poorer, and disappointed. This place makes you really appreciate how much good service factors into your dining experience.

Don't bother wasting your time here -- there are plenty of places with better food and certainly better service."
xwkE0jP_wLyuwAcsPBEuKg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I went here last night with three friends and the food was good, they had a nice summer menu and it was great to have fresh light food done well. The bread was fantastic and we had an heirloom tomato salad, tuna pizza and charcuterie place that were all perfect to start.  The main courses, my friend had tuna that was over cooked but the hallibut was excellent.  I liked the apps best (but I usually do) but all was good and the waiter knew the menu well.

As for atmosphere, the real draw of the place is the outdoor seating on the wharf. We had to sit inside due to a mix-up with reservations and were told to first wait in the bar and then told 'sorry your table outside is now gone'.  So they have some kinks to work out, but they were more then generous in their apologizing and showing their customer service skills by comping some parts of the bill."
NaXsIDq7pcWp9_B1UpPA9A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Asked to sit outside and were told there was a $25 minimum. Ok. That's fine. They fire up a grill that you can use for fondue or s'mores if you want to ""urban campfire.""  We didn't. What I wanted was a sazerac; after about 20 minutes, waiter came back with the news the bartender couldn't make me one because he didn't have any absinthe. Okay, I said it would be okay to substitute a bit of Pernod, but in case the bar didn't have that, I'd take a cucumber martini. 15 minutes later, I see a martini glass on a tray coming my way. It was the sweetest cucumber martini I've ever had. I think the bartender put limoncello in. For my next drink, I ordered a gin martini. The waiter brought me three olives (nice) and a slice (not a twist, mind you) of lemon and lime, so I could take my choice. My advice -- order what's on the drink menu. Best to keep it simple. Even if it is a ""bar"" and bistro. 

Oh yeah, we ate some food here.  The seared tuna was as advertised -- a small plate. Also had the sirloin tips with mushrooms. Was rare as requested.  

The outdoor seating is really wonderful. Tucked back in a courtyard off the street."
d0i8_nUYLNvfoIAiBspIXw,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"I had the lasagna al forno, which was wonderful. The restaurant seemed to work well the many families that were there. Since they have pizza, pasta, and more, it works for kids, old and young. The service was good and the staff was friendly.

Only complaint: the bread was cold."
bxjvAc13TXtnKIfQnIVunw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Found a Groupon and headed over with my mom after a bridal show on a Thursday night.  As we parked we noticed it was pretty empty except for a table outside, but we said what the heck let's give it a a shot.

We had just missed happy hour, lol. However they did offer a 2 for Tuesday for $15.99. Where you can get two past entrees for $15.99.  Now because we used the Groupon we could not do that deal but it worked out because moms wanted pizza. She opted for the formagio pizza and added pepperoni...she said it was delicious. I liked it but a little to much cheese for me (I know is there such a thing). I had the bolognese with spaghetti and from their recommendation added peppers, onions, and tomatoes (extra $2) and wow! So yummy, pasta was cooked nicely and the flavors were perfect (cant wait to eat my leftovers).  

If ur a after dinner coffee drinker, you just might be in luck. I'm not a a late night coffee drinker but the aroma was delightful.

All in all, get yourself over there and maybe I'll see you on my next trip!"

BVUJcs6Mk6WSXzPwpWPP6w,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I went here for an event, and since I was having a couple of glasses of wine, I made sure I ordered a little something to eat.  I opted for the sesame crusted tuna, served rare, (as it should be).  This was a perfect fit for my needs that night and was done very well.  The service was great, there was a cocktail server circulating, and he was attentive. This place is out of the way and not a place I'd know to look for, so I'm glad to know it's there for future reference when thinking about places near the water.  Unfortunately, it was raining that day, so I don't even know if they have outdoor seating/bar options."
miWzKW-z1yHNEoR9reeKnQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"First time at Aragosta. The food was awesome. Started with their shared meets and cheeses dish. My wife had the filet special and I the lobster Mac and cheese. Both had great flavor. I have had better steak at upscale restaurants, but would still order again. We ended the night on their patio roasting marshmallows by the fire pit. Great place and I would recommend. The only downside was the service. Very slow. You can also valet park for up to three hours for only $12. Worth it if its cold out."
TeDNAirK9z2W34VA5lOFOg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"This is not a review for the food as we weren't given the opportunity to actually get a table.  Three of my friends and I went on a Wednesday at 7 hoping to grab a bite to eat outside.  When we walked by the patio there were only two tables filled and plenty of open seating.  When we arrived at the host stand we waited for about 15 minutes and finally went up to the bar to ask who we should see for a table.  The bartender said to go back to the stand..after 10 more minutes a woman came up to us.  We asked for a table outside and she said the wait would be a half hour..Assuming that there must reservations coming in, we said that would be fine and got a drink at the bar.  I am used to paying for good service/food/drinks, but when I ordered a dirty martini it came out tasting like dirty soapy water, was filled barely halfway and cost $17! My friend was suggested to get a glass of merlot for a mere $22!  The other glasses of wine were $15 and $16.  We asked the hostess if it would be ok to sit in the small lobby area couches right in front of the host stand and wait  until our table was ready.  We sat there..and sat there..an hour later we went up to the stand again..and waited 15..then 20 min...Finally after about 2 hours total of waiting, a horrible expensive drink, and not seeing one other person come in for dinner we walked out..on our way we looked over to the patio which was COMPLETELY EMPTY!  I'm sure the food is great and maybe this was a really off day but unfortunately I won't be returning to find out."
N-HCq9-2l-sROpmZVAHS7A,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"It's a decent neighborhood Italian joint.

I have been coming here to Pasta Vino for a while and have always enjoyed their food. It's tucked away in a quaint section of the Peachtree Battle shopping center next to the Cheyenne Grille and it's been in business since 1989. It's a good ""1st date"" spot and it won't necessarily break your bank. 

I usually order the Insalata Della Casa which includes mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, olives, parmesan and sun dried tomatoes. The lettuce isn't the predictable pre-packaged shit most restaurants throw together. The lettuce actually tastes as though it's off the head and cut fresh. The dressing is a ""homemade"" variety and is light in flavor, It's usually one of my favorites.

Another one of my favorites is the Chicken Parmesan. I love how they actually pound the chicken breast and it's lightly breaded with mozzarella cheese on top. The marinara sauce is fresh and made on the spot. I have become a bit tired of all the canned crap a lot of these places serve. It also comes with a side of pasta for the carb fix.

I do recommend this place and it's always been consistent on quality. It's a nice departure form more of the flashy Italian joints in town."
Tuykq3BLumJsp8g-552AAw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"This place is ok. The service is insanely slow, had a burger and were here for 1:45 and still waiting for the bill. Burgers were ordered MR, came out M.. One with bacon, one without. You could also tell that instead of no cheese with burger, the cheese was scraped off. Not impressed."
dokCT2vbOcwCUkvFjNls5A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"I recently had dinner at Aragosta in Boston's North End. This upscale Italian restaurant in the Fairmont Hotel is surrounded by Boston harbor which you can see from their beautiful patio. The restaurant has a sophisticated and modern decor.  The menu includes typical Italian fare mixed with many local ingredients like lobster, PEI mussels and George's Banks scallops.

Main plates mostly range from $21 - $33 and while there are many tempting starters, I would suggest trying Aragosta's shared plate of meats, cheese and fish for $29.  The platter was more than enough for our party of four and was a delicious beginning to our meal.

I was tempted to try Chef Daniels daughter's favorite plate, Orecchiette D'Olivia, Lobster ""Mac & Cheese"", but I opted for the ""Piatti di Giorno"", which was veal parmesan.  This is a staple plate at any Italian restaurant and a personal favorite.  The red sauce was fresh and flavorful and combined nicely with the perfectly prepared veal; it was my very definition of comfort food. The one blemish to the dining experience was the lack of experience from our well-meaning but clearly green waitress.  When questioned about the menu her responses were stilted and unsure and when glasses ran empty she was slow to recognize or show herself to reorder another bottle (perhaps that's best - it did save us some money).

I would enjoy returning and trying another dinner, but I think next time I'll insist we dine outside on Aragosta's lovely patio."
ZJ9lKjMaLRVZcly5HbjwGg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"Went here twice for breakfast as we were staying in the hotel attached. First time food was great - great proportions, not greasy, very nice. Second time was completely different - food was greasy, proportions were a lot smaller and food was cool/cold. For the prices you pay here food should be consistent everyday with a decent amount of food and hot. Wouldn't recommend."
v7KJCdFbkB7Qfy5duAmqlQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"DO NOT recommend this place to anyone. The food is bland and boring. I ordered two slices of the prosciutto and arugula pizza which, on the menu states that it is their Margherita pizza  (tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella cheese..not their cheese pizza which is your basic cheese) with prosciutto and arugula. First, they brought out cheese pizza with the arugula and prosciutto. I asked the waiter if it was supposed to be Margherita pizza under the toppings..he just kinda looked and me and said sorry and took the pizza back. He brought it back a few minutes later...the SAME pizza just with tomatoes. They clearly don't know what Margherita pizza is. I was very disappointed. On top of the disappointing food, the service was bad too. We had to ask for drinks to be refilled. The employees were drinking on the clock in the open. Towards the end of the night all of the employees were out by the front talking loudly and one guy was openly drinking beer. I can easily say my family and I will never be going back there."
8ReG5kt7XAQUkVQxP0vbLQ,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"Great little brunch spot! We came here on a Saturday morning and sat outside with no wait at all. Of course we had to try both the Traditional Eggs Benedict and the Eggs Benedict Al Bacio. They were both amazing! The Eggs Benedict Al Bacio tasted like regular eggs benedict and pizza had a baby. It was a great Italian spin on the traditional dish. 
The prices are not bad and they have a $20 all you can drink option, but the menu is somewhat limited. The wait staff was very friendly and welcoming. This place feels like a hidden gem!"
GkkemP0wDrM8bN1yg2d9Kw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,Great place to eat. Friendly staff and good service. You get to talk to the owner who comes out and says hello. The food is plentiful and reasonable. The coffee is good and strong and the pastries were awesome. It's a cute place and at least you can get parking away from the busier part of Park Ave
eB9DecdV_3sw4j8ojgOm1A,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,2,"Meh,  I want to like this neighborhood Italian spot but it continues to fail to impress.  And is over priced.  My friend and I had dinner here recently, she is GF so the GF pasta option was a big draw for her.  

We sat outside in a beautiful fall evening. Service was rushed a spotty from the onset. Ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, GF pasta with clams and a pizza for the rest of us. Waiter failed to repeatedly bring a cooler for the wine, finally producing an over filled water pitcher for the wine chiller. 

GF pasta was bad, pasta itself undercooked, sauce had zero flavor but there were quite a few clams $20, Pizza was ok, not great. $20. 

Over the years, I have kept trying to live this place but not interested in mediocre, over priced food with lack of service."
HYo3nkUD3vd14KtN8HhuqQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,Just found this place looking for an Italian restaurant near my house. Had good reviews and only 0.6 miles from home so we chose Pasta Vino. Their food was delicious! The dishes were traditional and simple but the taste was surprisingly good! The prices were great too and I will definitely return the next time I'm craving Italian.
TmvXlgWQthB6TwFZV4b5Ig,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,"Beautiful, sparkling clean cafe. Walked in from the Morse Museum and ordered three salads to go. They were prepared reasonably fast. Appreciate the attention paid with making sure the order had utensils and napkins. These were great, fresh salads with a nice variety of ingredients. Really looking forward to coming again and eating in. Has sidewalk seating under canopy. Floor to ceiling Windows Ro the sidewalk and to the courtyard. Very nice"
wMCHSV7ejyi9bCb7vSsydw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,3,"3 1/2 Stars - I went here with my friends and my bf. We had a Groupon for 4 people which I would recommend. It was a Friday night and we wanted a simple, not crazy busy, quiet restaurant. This restaurant is the perfect choice. It's on Park Ave. but not in the busy part though we could walk to it. Parking was much easier since we used the garage close by. 

We ordered the calamari. The portion for it was a bit small. While we did enjoyed, the portion was too small. It was good for only two people but too big even for that. We just wanted more serving.

I ordered the Napoli with parppadelle noodles. The portion was a bit too small. I tend to get full easily but I actually was not close to full. I would have paid more for a little bit more portion. It felt like a lunch portion. The bread was great. We actually went later to eat more."
pzGLWgOdLABWD32k5chorg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Love this place! Great hidden gem if you love amazing gnocchi and vodka sauce.  This place home makes its gnocchi and you can tell because it is the most tender, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth pasta I have ever had.  I wish I could speak more to the rest of the menu, but I'm sentenced to life for that one dish-gladly."
XpfSYwRrwl9uqrkbWlsPCA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,Gorgeous location and atmosphere. Tuna flatbread app was awesome. Main meal was good but not best. Service was fine although our waiter was a bit awkward. Will definetely go back but maybe next time to bar area or patio.
s_DB4C8LO0QVsEUR5rcojQ,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Came here twice when I visited my younger sister in Boston. The first time was because I was on a hunt for olive oil cake (I've never tried it before!) and the second time was for my sister's birthday dinner, which happened to be during Boston Restaurant Week. This review is just for the dinner. I was there with my sister, our family friend, and two of my sister's friends from her summer internship. Honestly, the food was not that great; one of the plates came out completely cold! And not cold like it was waiting too long to be served, but cold as in it was as though the food was just taken out of a freezer... I don't even remember what we ordered because it was not that memorable. I only remember the gelato at the end -- I loved the limoncello gelato but that's because I like lemon anything.

The service was mediocre as well. They were very slow and unresponsive. Our server would be gone for long periods of time, even if we only asked for water. In addition, I had asked the server if they could give my sister a complimentary dessert or something because it was her birthday. They ended up just putting a candle in the olive oil cake that she had ordered as part of the Boston Restaurant Week prixe fixe menu. Not that I expected anything extravagant, but restaurants less upscale than this have made a much better effort than that. The other parties were getting much better service than we were, so ... meh."
QKioZ7NKRo7oORQl8rKvUA,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"Four of us came in for dinner on Saturday night and had such a terrible experience I had to provide feedback. All of us are young (mid thirties) successful professionals, who live in the city and dine out roughly 2 -3 times a week. We consider ourselves ""foodies"" we are well travelled and we have a high taste level (however not so much that we are snobby). 

 
When we arrived we checked in at the hostess stand (we had reservations). It should be noted that the hostess stand had a lot of commotion for what appreared to be a slow night.  They had quite a number of staff standing there, however no one could help me but the hostess, this created immediate confusion and a poor first impression. We opted to wait for a table outside, and had drinks while we waited at the bar, but after a long time we noticed that although many ""4tops"" were free and we had to flag down the hostess to remind her we were waiting and she then remembered and brought us outside to our seat. It should be noted that the hostess seemed very inexperienceds and scattered for a slow night..... she should have come over to us to tell us how long it would be and that our table was waiting.


Once we sat our ""food"" waiter introduced himself to us and told us that we could not order drinks with him but that we had a ""drink"" waitress and she would be right over. Really? Is this what they want? To have guests seated by someone that tells you what they cannot do? Ok... so we waited and waited for our ""drink"" waitress and after well over 10 minutes (we were FRUSTRATED) she came over. Once we ordered our wine and drinks our ""food"" waiter came over... Without bringing you through the entire meal and ALL of the times he was inappropriate and annoying I will just say this, he was the worst waiter we have ever had... keeping in mind that we have all dined out extensively both in the United States and abroad. He was obtuse, rude and rushed us our entire dinner. He harassed us to order, appetizers then dinner .... (came back incessantly, when we clearly were trying to talk and have a leisurely dinner), he didn't asked for the woman's orders first he just kind of went around the table.. (Manners?! Ladies are always first)... he cleared plates before everyone was finished (!! this is waiting tables 101...) and at one point (at 9:30) told us that the patio closes at 11 and that we had better order our entrees because at 11 we had to get off the patio. Really? Do guests want to be troubled by restaurant rules? If it is 9:30 and guests have till 11... surely they have enough time to eat and not be bothered w/ rules and feel like they are being rushed... At the end of our dinner when all but on person's plates were cleared (ugh!)... he came over to our friend once and asked to clear his plate... our friend was in the middle of telling a story and said politely no, he was not ready for it to be cleared. Then not even 5 minutes later he came back again and asked to clear it - our friend was STILL not done! But out of frustration said - ""yes - just take my plate!"" and instead of ordering more wine, after dinner drinks and dessert, we settled up, and went elsewhere. Vowing that regardless of a great view and just so-so food... (cheese board was outstanding as was the tuna crudo).... we would NEVER come back. 

Rookies!  It's too bad... as it has all the right makings for a true gem."

GIEg9mQULgTZj_pYwAZ2nA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,Very chill place with a wonderful ambiance. They have a nice selection of pastries and the service is very willing and friendly. It's usually not too packed since it's a block away from the busier part of Park Ave so if you're looking for more of a quiet place to enjoy great food with a nice view then this is your place.
z8eD1WxX04LXRcgS6lBVVg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Apparently, the wait staff has been in this place for like 50 years....but I think the lack of turnover has made them work at the pace of a snail.

I waited over 20 minutes for 2 slices of pepperoni.  20 minutes!  With no crowds!  I know they weren't tossing the dough for my 2 slices...

The pizza itself is not bad.  I've had worse.  Crust is decent but not spectacular, sauce is not sweet but not enough anyway, and good melt on the moz.  Pepperoni topping was clearly hormels pre-sliced crap.  The kicker: $7 for 2 slices of pepperoni is quite the rip.  $4.50 anyone???  

Not bad pizza, just not a 'wow', and not worth the wait or price.  I won't be back.  I give it my 'plain ole cheese in Atlanta' rating, from the NY Pizza Guy."
dEExMHL2Fn8OON_siPvViw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,"The location and view is great.  Comfortable seating on an outdoor patio, some with center fireplaces to keep that harbor chill out.  

The food was delicious.  I went for the shrimp scampi special.  I did enjoy it, just wish the portions were a little bigger.  

Definitely a nice place to hang with friends to share a drink or two or three and some apps."

6StRpyCimMCXaLssJB49yw,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,4,"A really nice place to have a light lunch and sip of wine on a weekday afternoon. 

They are dog-friendly (as is most of Winter Park), so that is a plus in my rating. 

They brought me furry friend and I water right away and were so pleasant.

I ordered a nice chardonnay to sip whilst choosing and ordering my food. I ordered  the Turkey Kiss salad, which was delicious. A strange mix of ingredients, I thought,  until I took my first bite, and second, and third. The chicken was grilled perfectly. I wasn't expecting the chicken to be freshly grilled (aka warm), but it was still delicious.

The service was very friendly and kind to my dog :-) 

The only downside was the pace. There were two people inside and myself, and the service was very slow. It didn't bother me at all as I was in no rush, but if you plan to stop by for a quick lunch, it won't be quick, but it'll be great."
SCIKF6PcP6pXRfTiSWUltw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,3,Went here for a surprise restaurant week date with my gf. Service was good waiter attentive but the kitchen was super noisy on a slow lunch shift. The lobster bisque was fantastic the Kobe beef burger however tasted like my moms meatloaf don't get me wrong I love my moms meatloaf but I was expecting more and it was overcooked (on a slow lunch?). The place was very cold too saw a bunch of people wearin sweaters and making comments and no one seemed to care. Oh yeah don't sit near a window sill unless you wanna done with some dead bugs. Location is actually very beautiful and if you get a chance use the bathrooms cause they're magical
QKyROJYAJZfyxuSmgkGklw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"This place is a bit of a pretender. I agree with earlier reviews that the the service is slow and weak. We had to repeatedly ask for service, drinks, bill.  These guys need to live up to the hype. Great location."
Ad4nChRXRNYPYvPATBDRig,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"A friend and I tried Aragosta Bar and Bistro for Dine Out Boston week. We had the porcini flatbread which was really good with a subtle mushroom flavor. We also did the tuna tartar. We liked the idea of the quail yolk and saffron which were different. I couldn't really pick up flavors of the saffron but the capers were a nice touch and the tuna was very fresh. I had the rigatoni bolognese. It had a touch of cream which added to the richness of the veal and oxtail ragu. Just the right size portion! My friend has the scallops, very well cooked with a perfect sear. I thought the golden raisins were a nice touch as well. We finished with tiramisu. While it wasn't the best I've had it was very good with the dolce de leche ice cream. I would go back here and possibly sit outside with the table side fire pits to get the gruyere fondue and s'mores!! The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because even though we had a reservation they made us wait 10 minutes in a restaurant that wasn't that busy..."
G_SpXNSxvbadNFPdDuv8XQ,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,3,"Pasta Vino has everything from garden variety lasagna and pasta marinara to so-called ""trendy"" selections.  Maybe I'm cheap and picky, but I did not feel the love.  For $18.00, I had a lasagna (and nothing else - I drank water) that was no better than what I can make at home.  It had plenty of time to cool, as the waiter forgot to bring me utensils and disappeared before I could let him know.  Someone from my table eventually hunted him down.  The outdoor dining is nice and relaxing, but for $18.00, I can feed my whole family on the patio for two nights and have leftovers.  If you are in Buckhead and absolutely have to have Italian, this might do the trick for you, but you may not find the food to be worth the price.  I didn't."

j6fbg2DYdNAktcSnFATXkw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,1,"We found a link to Aragosta's website in a recent Boston.com feature about things to do at the waterfront.  We waited for a table outside, unfortunately, could not see the water as a large bush blocked the view from our table.  We were seated at 1:30 and no one came to our table until 1:45, in which the hostess came and asked us if we had been welcomed yet.  She got our waters and the drink menu for us.  Our waitress finally came and took our drink/meal order.  So finally, at 2 we had our drinks.  In the meantime, the wait staff kept apologizing to the guests around us for the wait for their drinks and food.   At that point, we knew we were in for a long lunch.  Our meals arrived.  My Breakfast BLT was barely edible.  It was soggy and tasteless.  2 eggs, 2 slices of cheese, a little bacon, limp lettuce, and some orange sauce that reminded me of the ""special sauce"" on the Big Mac all contributed to the soggy mess.  It was also supposed to come with a salad and fries, instead I received a pile of new potatoes ??  My boyfriend ordered the Sophisticated burger, which was supposed to come with dijon, capers, and caramelized onions, which it didn't.  He ordered it medium, it came well done.  At that point, we just wanted to get out of there, and did not say anything as our waitress was extremely flustered due to it being busy.

It was a disappointing experience, especially since we made a point of going there to kick-off our day in Boston."

It's off the beaten path which means you can stop in and get a quick bite on weeknights, usually with no waits. Servers are friendly and they have a good wine list too."
gg8rUvwjDhUomdystB1f9g,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,We had a voucher deal so came to try Al Bacio. We had an excellent dining experience even with our two toddlers with us. The staff were all very friendly especially our waiter who made friends with our 18 month old. The food was excellent we had the calamari and both got the lobster ravioli and ate every bite of each! Even our picky three year old loved the lobster ravioli. We will definitely come back again and try more of the menu and for the excellent service!

We tried this one because of its proximity. The food quality is subpar and overpriced. My husband hand the gnocchi and I had the spaghetti with meatballs. Large (but flavorless) balls--they serve 3--with what seemed to be Ragu or possibly Chef Boyardee sauce. The meatballs were also not hot, tasting like they were reheated. Gnocchi was average, with slightly better flavor. Stale bread was served and entrees are served without salad. Thank God we didn't order wine! With entrees and one large San Pellegrino between us, the bill was nearly $50!!! Stay away!!!"
CV3ffWZfZ5xIzeH8z2iYRg,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,4,"I stopped in here with two friends on Thursday night for a small bite to eat and some drinks. We had just finished up at an event outside of the Battery Wharf hotel and my friend knew one of the bartenders (Patrick). 

The food was excellent - we ordered the hummus plate, truffle fries and a flatbread. The fries were definitely the best part, but the hummus plate was very well presented, too. I had already had some wine at the event we were at, so I decided to not get a drink at this bar, but one of my friend got a blueberry lemonade-type cocktail. I had a sip and it was delicious!

By the time we arrived here, it was close to 10 p.m. on Thursday. This is definitely the type of place I'd probably visit again simply for a post-dinner drink or quick bite, not for a full meal."

It was smaller than I expected but there's outdoor seating. In spite of their size they serve mimosas, beer, wine and yummy desserts.
I tried all their pasta options and every dish had the right amount of salt! Not sure why but my favorite was their Gnocci.
Each person was friendly, and they asked me about food allergies.
It was easy to find street parking considering it's more north on Park Ave, so it's not in a populous area.
I would definitely return again."

84Ae3d39ZQCb5LN1SXJGUA,_pqPht0BqDsU3Fcla_s7iw,5,Came to this place for dinner lastnight on the request from the gf. We sat outside on the small two person tops table. The waitress was attentive and took our order quick and with enthusiasm. Gf ordered the olive anchovies pasta while I ordered the pesto pasta with parm chicken on the recommendation from the waitress. It did not disappoint. The pasta with pesto sauce was warm and creamy while the parm chicken was hot with the perfectly melted cheese on top. Even the chicken was still crispy underneath. We were impressed by the food and service. We'll try to sit inside next time to get another feedback inside the restaurant.
1RUoAI88PhXU83tKUeTeTg,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,1,"This is  the absolute WORST ITALIAN restaurant in 52 yrs of living in the Atlanta area, DO NOT DINE here, the worst service , which i could deal with if the food was eatable! We had the veal and it was so tough we could not even cut it with our knife, the bread was stale and dry, we will never go here again, just horrible and not fit to eat, had better meals at the Golden Coral !!!"
yLT2iI_suSsCeEv9vWjd8A,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,2,"Great view.  Small portions, HORRIBLE SERVICE!
I made a reservation through open table for a special occasion and made literally FOUR phone calls to the restaurant as well as 2 emails to see what the managers could do for a special occasion.  No one ever bothered to return my call. Each time I called, no one answered the phone.  I almost changed our reservation last minute but really did want the water view outdoor seating and all day brunch - so we went.  When we arrived, no one was at the host station for about 15 minutes, we had to wander inside and ask if anyone was working.  Finally, we were sat outside.  The host never bothered to check off our open table reservation or even ask our name, so we didn't get credit for it.

We sat outside for 25 minutes before anyone even came over to fill our water glasses or bring us a menu.  Finally, I again wandered inside to ask if there was a waitress.  She finally came out.  She was sweet enough once we did finally meet her but she never came back to ask how our meal was after she brought it and we were stuck there for 2 hours in total between being seated, eating and finally paying the check.  We sat with dirty dishes in front of us for 30 minutes before someone came out to clear them and bring our check.

No special occasion was ever acknowledged because no one bothered to call me back or to acknowledge my notes on open table.  

Food was only mediocre, very small portions and severely over-priced.

WE WILL NEVER RETURN!  Beyond overrated.  There are plenty of water views in Boston.  Skip this one. I feel bad for the people staying at the hotel that have this as their closest restaurant.  Service is everything, and you by far fall short in an area that it's so easy to meet."
ipgTl8weZiLS-1bpktNC4g,eLrJdEYwxzJgddnqawDQ1g,4,"Not our first choice, on a Friday Night in Atl, but we did find Pasta Vino while out looking for dinner, and fortunately they had at least one available table for us, which we happily decided to take.  

Staff were quick to get us our water and complimentary bread.  I thought it was interesting that the bread came with butter and while olive oil was on the table, it wasn't poured for the bread, like so many other italian places do.  No worries though, as I had hands and could pour my own.

After going back and forth on the menu, and having the menu and some of their best selling dishes on the menu pointed out to us, we ordered the following:

Goat Cheese & Apple Ravioli ($17)
Minestrone zuppe ($7)
Lamb bolognese parpardelle ($18)

Starting with the Minestrone, the soup came in a cup, and it wasn't bad...it sorta sits in the middle of the road in terms of minestrones i've had.

The Lamb bolognese parpardelle wasn't my dish, but I had a couple of tastes of it, and the flavor was there.  Very potent flavors, soft noodles, yummy!  This was the star dish of the night for me, although it was funny that it seemed we liked each other's dishes better than our own.

The Goat Cheese & Apple Ravioli was fantastic with the first bite, but then it got creamy.  REAL creamy.  Over the ravioli was an apple glaze that made the ravioli apple sweet, and that sweetness cut into the super rich goat cheese, stuffed into the ravioli.  I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese myself, but if you love goat cheese, this dish may be yours to order.  For me, if the apple glaze was not there, I could not have finished it, and in fact, I didn't finish the ravioli, leaving a few behind.  

Customer service was just fine here, minus the innocent and mistaken slap they gave to my date, who took it in stride.  Service was generally fast, having the soup come out within 5 minutes of ordering, and entrees just a few minutes later.  This place is more on the intimate side, having room to seat maybe 30 people inside, although there is patio seating as well.

Located in a restaurant strip, parking isn't an issue here, though you likely wont get any parking right in front of the restaurant, but that's okay.  There is also at least one red light exit as well.

If i'm being honest, i'd give Pasta Vino a 3.5, and i'd round them up to 4 because they had juuuuust enough flavor to make it.  Would I come back?  Sure.  I'd give them a chance to truly earn their 4 stars by selecting another dish that may be not as rich for my tastebuds.  I hope I get to try them again soon."
nkLVNNnMzfMqczQwnt89Sw,kVI7NL59MPnYTx3Lg6PMTw,5,"My friends and I were excited to try this new restaurant in the North End and we loved it! We went there for dinner and the Italian/Mediterranean Open Kitchen concept was fresh and creative and a nice change from the other Italian restaurants in the North End. 
I had the rigatoni that was so flavorful and so good and I also tried the gnocchi from my friend that was just as good. Our server was pleasant, informed and made sure we had everything we wanted. The manager was also friendly and suggested a wine to pair with our meal.
Excellent food. Excellent location. Excellent staff. We will definitely be back!"
