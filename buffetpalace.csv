"5CUCpTaV-YR2DzYHjpgQyQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"This might be the best Chinese buffet in Austin Texas. Clean, friendly, with good food as long as you go during lunch or dinner hours (it gets pretty stale during off hours, but that seems to be an issue with most buffet places). Their sushi bar is out of this world with freshness and selection. I've been going here for years, and I'd say 80% of my trips have been very satisfactory, with my only so-so experiences being when I've gone during off hours. The dessert bar is okay, but they have a ton of fresh fruit and their apple crisp is very good."
"nPuZpbJA0a5qFLxIhENs3A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"This place is the epitome of average as far as quality of food goes. The sushi was okay, the chicken was hard to chew (like unbearably hard to chew) and the overall taste of everything else I tried was left to be desired. The place itself is interesting and has a cool aesthetic but the quality really just wasn't there. Not to mention, it is extremely overpriced. I don't mind paying extra for quality food/service but I don't see how they justify their steep prices (on a Friday) for the most mediocre of foods. However, the staff was really nice and seemed to thoroughly enjoy working there, so that's a positive. Even with that said, I probably won't ever come back again."
"GvCxu0pSpPrmvi1Hkms0uA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"For about $12, this is the best Asian buffet in town.  You get sushi, a whole spread of Korean dishes, and the staple Chinese dishes (probably north of 30 options?).  There are soups, vegetarian options, and desserts available.  You can literally eat yourself into a coma and not realize it.

Favorites: mussels, salmon, bulgogi, sushi, jap chae, jalapeno shrimp, peach cobbler+vanilla soft serve + banana pudding.

I'll be back, and so should you."
"YzuNzsuIL4hKMFfNn1oo6w","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Place is good for a buffet. They used to have lot of foods but nowadays I don't find too many options. they also have Sushi it not great but it is good on a buffet menu. 
I would say this place can be little more clean. overall I can say it is worth for the money."
"YhzM2rwEQIIVCANtvqgeMA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"This is hands down the best buffet in Austin. I've never had a bad meal here. Everything is pretty tasty but the highlights are the galbi (on weekends), the seafood salad, chicken wings, terriyaki chicken, dumplings, veggie fritters, Jap chae, and the sushi is pretty good for buffet sushi (which is not an easy accomplishment). I've been coming here for over 11 years and it's always a good experience. Service is good even when they are busy. The bathrooms could be a little better, as partitions in the men's room stalls are falling apart. There's lots of good dessert there too, including pies, cakes, ice cream, and cobbler, all of it looks appealing and fresh."
"9UAQt9xBz9dw09iA8HxC4A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Hit or miss on the food selection but overall pretty good. The servers are SO friendly here. And for the amount of food I usually eat, it's worth the price. Come hungry."
"dHUazCfaAy63OukPrWU6bQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"It's hard to get excited about a Chinese buffet.  And this one didn't disappoint.  
Large buffet.  Lots of choices.  Food was average nothing special.  Rolls were flavorless.
As for cleanliness, table was sticky like they just wiped down and didn't clean it.   
So if you're set on a buffet and need to get full, this one will do that.  
Not much else to say."
"ESpFD0ccviVm8fA3VlsNuA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"This is a go to favorite for lunch with my coworkers. This place has EVERYTHING. I love the fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and bulgogi beef. Great for big groups!"
"yCh_8mRrRrr0UFjxdsRu8w","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"I go to this place in rare moon. it's one of the place that you just go in and eat. I eat here when I want to be alone and I don't want to be bother.  I am usually reading a book or Austin Chronicles.  I think the restaurant could be better when it come to tables being cleaner.  The reason I keep coming back is because they food doesn't stay long in the trays for a long period of time since they have so many patrons. 

A metaphor would be: this place is not like a Lexus but more of Honda."
"ci19zQA14vqv0gRf_PXLPQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Place has plenty of food and dessert even for the pockets eater. Place is great when no one could decide what to eat ..."
"7JEMxPNB045NxlAauv5_3Q","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"I hate buffets but remembered how good this was several years ago when I was in Austin.  Hands down the best buffet I've ever been to.  Excellent presentation. Chef was inspecting all dishes while I was there. Great flavor and huge variety.  Even the iced tea was excellent.  Great service and for 9.50 this was a real treat for us today.   Sushi rolls were phenomenal and so well presented and prepared.  You guys really do a great job."
"epfJ1TAU0XYXHbBatRZiag","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"Nice, well layed out buffet, and the Korean dishes were the reason I wanted to eat here. As with most Sundays, families were out in full eating force, and almost every table was full of families with plates piled high of everything Asian. The fried rice was fresh, the Korean vegetable pancakes crispy, and velvety at the same time. Pan fried mandu dumplings were tasty, the skins a little chewy. The Korean sides of bean sprouts, kimchi, and seaweed salad were all flavorful, and well prepared for a buffet.  The Korean short ribs (galbi) must be one of the most popular offerings here, I did not try them, but diners around me were partaking in stacks of the galbi. The spicy Korean tofu soup was filling with tofu, shrimp, and zucchini. The broth a fiery red, tasty, but not so spicy you wouldn't be able to eat it. 
I skipped dessert, but did take a quick look over. The cakes, and ice cream were popular with diners all around me. For the price, and offerings of food, I'd say this is a great deal. Service was friendly, parking lot navigable, and overall experience one of the better ones for a buffet."
"eZU4Rgrb_C2udrbVk7V6Hg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"Food is ehhh.  I didnt like everything.  The salad isn't fresh, taste old.   The hot food is just ok, some are good, some are just cold.  Not impressed overall and for the price is definitely not worth it."
"_3WVmtAH8fUEWh4RkESm1Q","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"Gross. Would not recommend. Used to be better. 

Saturday night and food was cold, unflavorful. Honestly not a single dish was appetizing. Large selection though."
"6Fp9kql6A5equ4yyuAB1kw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"We have visited this Buffet Palace, and notice they are seriously downgrading the quality and selection of the foods. Now the food left there are very cheap and low-end. Another buffet restaurant we usually visit is Buffet King in north Austin. As we compare two buffet restaurants, this one is more expensive and has much cheaper foods. Another small problem with this restaurant is that their foods are usually over burned, not good for heath. One more issue is that they stop making foods more than 1 hour before they close. It means if you go there late, it will be difficult to get fresh foods there."
"4nE9jNip-8fHEXyIqsqocg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"What's this? A good Chinese buffet in Austin? Umm, as long as you avoid the Chinese. Don't get me wrong: the Chinese food isn't bad, it's just that it's your standard Americanized-Chinese buffet fare: chicken, beef, and pork in cloyingly heavy sauces. They have some more upscale items, like salmon, but their upscale items get dried out after sitting under the heat lamps for a while, and aren't that great even if you get to them right as they're delivered. And they've got the  usual stuff like pizza, for picky eaters who walked into a Chinese buffet but didn't want Chinese food.

The freshness of the sushi isn't bad, for a buffet, but the rolls are 99 and 44/100% pure rice and .56% sushi.

So why am I giving this place five stars? First of all, expectations are just lower at a buffet. But more importantly, the Korean food here is actually good. Multiple types of kimchi, bulgogi, soup, seaweed salad, jap chae, not to mention multiple variates of ceviche (including Korean octupus ceviche), plus a good selection of dumplings. If you just want one dish, you can do better for the same price at Korean Grill, Manna, Misung 888, New Oriental Market, Chosun Galbi, Shilla, Osaka Mansun, Odaku Sushi, or Korean Garden, but you can't beat the variety here."
"hhPAVYsde-xqhwgN2Ws_Vg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"After reading others' reviews, I was a bit hesitant to check this place out but I am glad I did. They serve excellent food of a wide variety: Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and South Asian. I agree with previous reviewers that their sushi isn't top of the line, but I have eaten worse. After all, this ISN'T a sushi restaurant; They just throw them in in addition to many other tasty dishes. If you love sea food, you'd love the selection there. Where else would you go to eat that much quality food for $11? It was entertaining just to be there. I've been to asian buffets in many large cities and this one stands out. Highly recommended!"
"LKHAs-qZwNTT-YRhT1VizA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"This is probably THE best Asian buffet in town. The caveat is, of course, that it is still a buffet, so it won't be as fresh and tasty as what you would find in a sit-down restaurant.  There are a ton of average/mediocre buffets in Austin, none of which make me really WANT to go there. Buffet Palace is one I'll make an exception for. There are two things which stand out here:
1) Makizushi
2) Some Korean foods

Let me start with the Korean food. There is Bulgoki, pork Bulgoki, Kimchi, and a two very good soups. My all time favorite is Dak Yukgaejang. I like it so much I've tried making it at home. Think of it as a spicy chicken vegetable soup. It has diakon, chicken, beans sprouts, onions, and a nice spicy broth. The Kimchi is OK, and the Bulgoki is not bad at all.

The Makizushi is good. For a buffet, they make some really tasty rolls. They have your traditional rolls, but they have really gone above and beyond in coming up with their own variations which are very tasty and I give them  a lot of kudos for that.

Their entrees are also nice and flavorful, and they have some things that you don't find in a lot of other buffets. On top of that, due to the relatively high volume of traffic, the food is brought out fairly frequently before it has a chance to go stale. That makes you almost forget you're eating at a buffet.

If you're looking for a buffet, but you're tired of the average buffet with stale food and so-so selection, go to Buffet Palace."
"fk1U_3HvnUb0fMDypbgkfQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Best Chinese buffet I've been to in Austin and I've been to a lot. Great selection. Fresh food. Clean. Great service. I will definitely be here OFTEN"
"uxNDW0GvtSbwSK5-UA2FkA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"It's voted the number 1 buffet in austin for the last 8 years (or something like that) for a reason! The food is great and tasty, and the service is good. Although I don't like the spring rolls and sushi.. I would still highly recommend!"
"0VExNdVkEnHmnS_Q4P7J5A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"Great food for people who know nothing about how Chinese food should taste. Everything from the soup to the kung pao chicken is blander and greasier  than even the standard strip-joint Chinese restaurant. 

But that's not what prompted this review. Had a Groupon; the waitress added 15 percent tip on the bill ($4.50). This has never happened with a Groupon before, but what the hell. I put the credit card on the tray. Back comes the billing slip--itemized receipt I didn't pocket is now gone--showing an 11.48 bill and a 1.51 included tip, and a request for a more robust tip. That is, they're hoping you missed the fact that 4.50 was added on, so you add another 3 bucks for a 7 dollar tip on buffet service (bussing the freaking table). Criminal. If you're indeed attracted to this grease-laden crappy food, be sure to keep a vigilant eye on your check."
"N10DpqMOcnwFpLuCVcgXgQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"My wife and I ate here during our last night of an Austin vacation. It was something quick and easy with wide selection for both veg and non-veg. I found a lot of the dishes I tried much too bland or oddly flavored. There were some very tasty desserts and the place seemed clean enough. Service was pretty good but there was a lot of cross contamination of foods. In short, while we weren't looking for anything thrilling this place did disappoint."
"lLqz9SFaAgYf_jAMNTgaiQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I go once or twice a month and it is what it is.  All you can eat food for an acceptable price.  Sure the food is not cooked to order but it is edible and for the most part quite good.  Sushi selection is decent.  Cold salad selection is good.  Sake and beer available which is a plus as most buffets in Austin are dry.  Staff sing happy birthday and bang on drums."
"94zafA-KuobMjJoTRwPJlA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"This is our fun night out location for our kids. It is good, as far as buffets go. The restaurant is always very clean, and they have a good variety of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean food. The kimchi is pretty good, and the sushi above average for a buffet, but not as good as what you get in a sushi dedicated eatery.

Lots of seafood and shellfish also, and even LA ribs on most nights.

The desserts are also above average for a buffet.

My rating reflects four stars as a buffet only."
"3TiDetQtKmzwpNpKJyMGOg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Still good every time we go! My boyfriend loves the huge selection here. Food is always fresh and the restaurant is kept clean. A little more expensive but worth the money! :)"
"JTvwxzLVes3e-oOmv3RnJA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"I wish that Austin had a better selection of greasy chinese buffets. We've all been to that low point in our lives where nothing will cure our seemingly endless depression like an all you can eat buffet of MSG. Wait- that's just me? Anyway Buffet Palace used to be the shit when it was the head honcho of Austin's buffet scene. But we have grown as a city and unfortunately Buffet Palace got left behind."
"q1_-MtfDiMpiVk3wKHrPgw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"I use to eat here more often when I lived in South Austin and this was my first time back since moving up north, over 2 years ago.   I was always a fan of the Spicy Chicken soup and this was the reason for my return. 

I was so disappointed - the chicken has been replaced with TOFU!!!  The broth was still good but I could not see any chicken although the name was still the same....

Service was ok, use to be better.. they have more dipping sauces to choose from but this place has changed, and not for the better.  The sushi was not as fresh, the crab rangoons didn't not have much if any cream cheese as that texture was not creamy and it looked horrid and did not taste much better.  The desserts actually improved though which was surprising.

To sum it up, the food and service got worse yet the prices went up.  I will not be returning here at all and left extremely disappointed as this was the only half way decent oriental buffet place in Austin... now I can officially say that all oriental buffet restaurants in Austin are nasty - do not waste your money!"
"rYl112NjuNoUauS20vK6Zg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"WOW!  Being new to Austin, finding a great Chinese buffet has been challenging. Thankfully, I found buffet palace! EVERYTHING is fresh, clean, and delicious! Tons of variety from sushi to sesame chicken to various salads! Not to mention the dessert size! Tried every cake (mini portions which is nice) and all were amazing! Ice cream on point. Will definitely be returning asap! Great service, friendly environment, tables were clean!  Check this place out!"
"sEO-_lxq9nXJ0rnSL4Zz2w","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Lots of selection here! I was fascinated at how many soups they have here. They were good but I don't fill up on soups at buffets!

The korean marinated short ribs were probably the best thing and they make it right on the buffet line! Good flavor and always tender. There is lots of seafood on the line: shrimp, crab, mussels and more! Those are just what I go for. The sushi there is okay but not the best and lots of rice on the rolls. 

The rest of the buffet line has your standard fried rice, noodles, sesame chicken, etc. All of it tastes good but go for the korean marinated short ribs."
"s3BMyzUgGTN0WZj5iacdNg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"Terrible... I've been to many buffets in my lifetime and this was the worst. Couldn't even finish a whole plate. Egg drop soup was a gross pale color. The food was cold except the sushi it was nice and warm (grosssss)!!! Would not recommend to anyone !!! Waste of 25$...."

"yq9VMajCg9-7rhIW6HdaAw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I'm there about once a week. The salmon is usually my favorite - though every once and a while it is way too dry. Sushi is pretty good, and they have a nice variety. I've always had very nice waitpersons - one hugs me when I come in."
"ImPOkD9_-38mGWXnkxFNhg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"I've never been more impressed with a Chinese buffet! 

The food was fresh and delicious. There was tons of quality dishes to choose from. Some of my faves were the fried blue crab, orange shrimp, Korean beef rib, and the assorted sushi. 

They have bok choy, kimchi, seafood soup, teriyaki chicken, and so much more. I was too stuffed for dessert but I seen cheesecake, ice cream, cookies, peach cobbler, and more. 

The sushi is great, tons of rolls to choose from. I enjoyed the unagi and their crunchy roll (forgot the name of it). 

My waitress kept our water glasses full and cleared dirty plates fast.

It was $14 for adults and totally worth it."
"ly9sjKaVZfjBcVCbjH5x4A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"No complains. Pricing is good. The selection of food is better than most Chinese buffet I have been to. Service is great. I went around 3pm and it was not crowded at all.

To whatever wasn't happy with their military discount policy:
Don't take things for granted. Nobody owns you anything because you picked a job in the military. You already get so many benefits funded by taxpayers. Be grateful, not greedy!

Btw can someone post a picture of takeout price? Thanks."

The hot and sour soup tasted top class, as did the kung po chicken, grilled chicken, fried rice. I also liked the sushi with the cream cheese in it. 

For the price, (about $10 a head)  the food was great! 

Oh, kids eat free on Mondays. Good news for some, but i'll be staying away!"
"EjH0DS4s6CqCdgXR4739lg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"I decided to give buffet palace another try after a terrible experience about 3 years ago, mainly due to horrendous service.

Food
Likes: The food varied from ok to delicious. I love how Korean cuisine is widely represented as I've noticed from other Asian buffets that its usually represented minimally. 
The must try dishes were the jap chae noodles, salads, spicy orange shrimp, lo mein, baked salmon (cooked beautifully) and vegetable egg rolls with mushrooms (awesome for vegetarians as most egg rolls come with pork). I loved the variety of both noodle dishes and soups and salads.
Dislikes:  I wasn't excited about the sushi, I have very high standards for my sushi and you can tell they were stingy with sashimi/ raw fish rolls. They didn't have inari, eel, tuna or salmon (raw), or fresh seaweed rolls. Overall they were ok because I've experienced much better sushi options at other buffets. 
I also wasn't a fan of the desert options. The only fruit I saw was watermelon. I would've passed on the sesame ball had I known it was filled with sweet red bean paste.

Atmosphere
I went on a busy Friday night so it was impressive to see that all the dishes were adequately filled at all times. The location of the food was awesome as there was plenty of room for everyone to walk around. Because It was busy, I was seated in an opened party room. The A/C must have not been working properly because we were seated right next to a fan, there were many throughout the restaurant, but this was a minor inconvenience. What did frighten me was that the floors were clearly wet when I first came in, I had to cling to my boyfriend from not slipping in my heels. 

Service
Our waiter was absolutely amazing! You can tell they really cared about their service as all waiters were always in view in case anyone needed anything. My waiter was observant, funny, and quick. Water was filled at all times, he brought extra napkins twice without us asking, finished plates were promptly removed, and we weren't rushed at all.

Overall the food was ok, I really only see myself coming back if I need a place to eat with a large party due to short waits, good seating, variety of dishes, and great service."
"72yQSgXIpZjyvnPblw4UDw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I really like how you can eat healthy here. It's Chinese, Korean, Japanese, American and even a little Mexican food all put together. Lots of variations of veggies, meats, and soups. Desserts are just OK, great sushi selection, love their seaweed, misosoup, egg drop soup, fried rice, chicken teriyaki, and salads. They are not like a typical Chinese restaurant with cheap food, this one doesn't have the canned corn or iceberg lettuce as a buffet option. I really think they are better than that.  Great for bringing big groups or just going by yourself. A downside is the price. Great place and I would recommend this place!"
"RmvMuXa1JxA3rwCLCmEJcw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"just. don't. do. it.

get in your car again. drive to houston. or, better yet, go to hong kong, taiwan or mainland china.

variety is not always a good thing.  buffets like this give chinese food a bad, brown, greasy name.

do your waist-line a favor and steer clear.

spend your money on some good ingredients, spend your time learning how to cook, make *actual* chinese food instead.

every meal i ate here, (a favorite of a few people i won't mention) left me feeling sad, and a little queasy.

ignorance is not an excuse to eat this stuff.  thinking this is even tangentially related to chinese food is akin to believing that mcdonald's serves great american hamburgers.

Decor is pleasant so is the staff. I wish the sushi rolls didn't all have cream cheese. Substitute avacado or veggies. It'd be nice to have a few tempura/traditional rolls instead of the heavy sauce rolls. Price isnt bad either. Got the munchies?.. this is an ideal choice."

Thankfully, I think Christmas saved us all. They were packed when we arrived. The food turnover was quick thanks to the shopping frenzy happening all over town. The majority of the pans were fresh food. Here's a recap: 

Spicy Salmon Roll 
Inari - mmmmm yummy stuff 
Coconut Curry Chicken with Long Beans 
Pan Fried Dumplings 
Kimchee 
Spinach Salad with Spicy Dressing 
Bean Sprout Salad 
Spring Rolls 
Tempura Sweet Potato 

Rooster fared well with some white rice and some swirl soft serve for his dessert. Jenny pointed out its fun to see the kids create their ice cream masterpieces and then rush back to the table to gobble them up. David L's suggestion about the doughnuts and ice cream was a hit. 

Our lunch companions had nothing but praise for their selections as well. So you got me Buffet Palace; even if its thanks to the holidays. I award another star for a stellar performance. Yes, the buffet master is back!"

They have so many things that are not ordinary.   The salads are not iceberg lettuce and few toppings.  They make specialty salads.

The hot entrees are not all the usual fare as well.  The sushi is manly rolls but interesting.  One of them has vermicelli in it and I have never seen one like that.

I have not experienced a bad visit at any of the 20 plus times I have gone for weekday lunch.   The choices are great and every dish is very tasty.  I like to start off with peel and eat boiled shrimp then go on to the other dishes.   One thing I like about the buffet is that they keep the dishes looking fresh as if they just put each one out right before you walked up to spoon some on your plate.  Some buffets just look gross after the food has sat there for an hour or more, not Buffet Palace.  I must say I was disappointed to go there on a Sunday for the lunch buffet thinking that the $4-$5 higher price would give me more choices or maybe some crab legs as an added bonus but no luck, same choices on Sunday so I will only go during the week to get the best lunch buffet price.  Over all I recommend this buffet.  It would have to be a super-star buffet (with crab legs) for me to give 5 stars."

There are tons of selections if you are in salads or sushi. I am not a big sushi eater, so I skipped that side of the bar. The orange shrimp was over cooked. The sweet and sour chicken was also over cooked.  The soup was ok. I have had better selection of entrees at other Chinese restaurants. 

It was not worth the $11.99 per adult price for Sunday Lunch. That is probably the most I have ever paid for a Chinese Buffet. I have eaten at this place before and it was good at the time. I am not sure what happened to the food quality. It had gone way down."

Overall restaurant appeared pretty clean table and utensil wise, windows could have been cleaned up next to the booth that I was seated at. It was very obvious some kid got his hands in the chow main and decided to paint greasy animals on the windows. 

Food selections were average for a buffet. You had pick of the standards, beef and broccoli, chow main, sesame chicken. Could have done with a few more protein choices, but was satisfied enough with what was offered. Huge selection on sushi and desserts."
"V6ozHAna5Qsas-jqjNAvOQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"What does a 'bad' review look like, you ask? After all, for the most part, I've stuck to writing reviews on 'better' or 'good' places.  

I tell you, a bad review looks like a pile of fetid garbage. A bad review also resembles a rat caught in a sticky trap. 
or maybe roaches crawling over the left-over pizza you wanted to have for breakfast.

But since I can't/don't want to chat about those things, I'll have you know that a bad review looks a lot like Buffet Palace, so let's get to it...

I tend to not eat at buffet-type places, reason being that I'm just not into the whole 'human trough' thing, you know? Call me elitist or whatever, but buffets generally are the not the way one should enjoy food, as you're generally going for quantity over quality. 

That said, once upon a time, because Andrew was hungry, was coming out of a movie and was craving Chinese food, he immediately gravitated to Buffet Palace. 

At first, I thought that it seemed like a pretty respectable buffet. The place was newer and nice looking on the inside, and the buffet itself takes up quite a large portion of the space. There are TONS upon veritable tons of different kinds of food available here.  

That said, these are the two things that are keeping this sad sack of a place from a flat 1.

Calling what you eat here 'food' is kind of like crediting George W. Bush with a modicum of 'smarts'...it's just not really that accurate of a statement. There is mass produced food, and then there is mass produced food that looks nice.  Everything at Buffet Palace certainly looks appetizing, but in reality, once you start making the transition of the food from your plate to your mouth, that's where the problems begin...and call me crazy...but that's a hell of a problem to have when you're in the business of serving up food. 

I remember the first bite of food I had from my plate tasting a little like A) children's paste, B) a verp (for those not in the know, that's a burp that has a little bit of vomit mixed in for fun and foulness) and C) death. What does death taste like? It  resembles what the 4th part of a bad review looks like. See above.

General Tso's tasted like re-runs of General Hospital; kind of edible/watchable but not something you want long term. 

There was some kind of barbecue something-or-other on a stick that looked amazing, but I think I would've done better by trying to figure out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a soap-on-a-rope in a prison shower.  

The noodles in the chicken lo-mein were stringy, slimy and lukewarm...three things that I do not want to think of when I'm trying to eat noodles. The chicken was...I don't know...maybe chicken? Maybe it was a pigeon?  The vegetables were  limp and not-so-fresh. It was kind of like they microwaved some vegetables yesterday and nobody ate them, so they saved them, mixed them in while they were making the day's gruel, and just tossed it in with the dishes that required limp, not-so-fresh vegetables. Gross.

There were two severe kicks in the arse. One a large deep tray of crab legs. Seriously...I wanted to barge through the kitchen door and scream at whomever the 'cook' was. These things were naaasty. I poked at one with the serving tongs, and because the shells had been exposed to a lot of 'wet', they were becoming pretty soft...soft enough to put a little crack in one at my gentle and grossly fascinated prodding.  The other one was the sushi. Come on, man...are you KIDDING ME?! Does someone actually think I'm going to try raw fish from a place that can't even get cooked mass food...cooked FRIED food...down? I'd rather shoot multiple BBs into my ear, hoping that the force from one after the other would eventually shove one deep into into my brain so that I would cease to live rather than eat anything remotely resembling sushi from Buffet Palace.

This one is not a winner, friends. Run, don't walk away, from here."
"evnphj2MKokOpjell441hg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"I'm definitely very impressed with this buffet! I usually dislike buffets because of the quality of the food but this place was AMAZING, love that they're not the typical buffet that serves nuggets and fries etc (junk food) they have a lot of great quality food and seems very selected.

"b19CpcThKNz79oUfTu_Jgg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"This place is the best! It is rare to find a restaurant that consistently offers such excellent quality food and service. I always walk out happy. All of the food is great but I especially like the mussels."

My favorites are the korean bbq, fried rice, seafood dynamite, pot stickers, sesame chicken, sushi rolls and many more items.  I highly recommend this place!"
"SQ1yIYAgD8_PyFEREuTiVQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"I think it's gotten...better?!?

The joke was that when I was pregnant, I craved this place like crazy and we went there weekly and even twice a week ! (my poor, patient husband...)

We joke how I only liked it b/c of weird pregnant lady cravings, so tried it again this Saturday. Could it be that it was better than I remembered? We did go on Saturday at peak dinner time, so I'm thinking the food had high turnover so was very fresh. But also I noticed that they had more Korean dishes and they upped the different desserts! (omg they had those sesame balls which I love).  

Again, it's a buffet, so expect a...buffet, but it's the best one I've been to (outside of Vegas of course).  I always thought it was very clean and is still clean and I like how the staff pick up your dirty plates right away. 

There were some newer dishes that were very good: Chinese fried crab, Korean pork belly, new sushi choices. Oh, they must have upgraded their Kimchi supplier, because it tasted much better than the previous Kimchi they had. 

The only negative is that everything looks so good that you taste everything and end up rolling out of there. 

I have a weird obsession with buffets (Chinese and others) and this is the only chinese buffet I will eat in the Austin area."

"cf6nFE2n6Pka5tUu4770Zg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"We stopped in here before a movie across the street last week. The sesame chicken was decent enough. Someone else mentioned the crab puffs. They were okay but obviously light on the crab. Hot and Sour soup was a too watery the day I was there. Sushi looked like a disaster area with california rolls just falling apart.  Sounds like this is one of those places that puts ""better"" sushi out at night. And I put better in quotes because is buffet sushi REALLY that good? Uh . . . no.  Fried rice was bland, but I mixed in some hot pepper oil. Sauces are readily available on the buffet and they provide small cups for them.

And that's about all I ate here. Yeah I probably didn't get my money's worth. 

I really can't really see myself making a special trip here. If we were hitting a movie again and needed a quick bite, perhaps we'd go."

All the sushi you could desire, a wide variety of gluten free and vegan options, and sesame chicken that (excuse my French) can only be described as orgasmic. Buffet palace truly made me feel like I was transported to Southeast Asia and enjoyed a great home cooked meal before sleeping on my beanbag. The only lacking aspect was the quality of the food was subpar, my cashier was an 11 year old girl, and I could see the Nike factory downstairs from my seat."
"Mwk4N5pVxUxlBWVLjJ_FBw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"GREAT FOOD, there wasn't a big section of food. But the Korean pancake and the pot sticker was great. Kimchi was warm, Needed to be colder.

"rZ_bVy-WWkM9uYLhE78EJA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"So my father decided that he was in the mood to have lunch at a Chinese buffet and we decided to dine at this establishment. Upon entering, we noticed that the sidewalk around the front entrance had an unsightly amount of black goop from old chewing gum speckled about. The interior seemed fine and they had a very wide selection of food and desserts. The service was very prompt and professional. 

We made our way to the buffet table and I started plating some delicious looking curried chicken and vegetable tempura. That is when I made a disturbing discovery. Along the buffet side was an extra bloated and sluggish German cockroach just casually crawling about during daylight hours. I immediately felt nauseated which caused me to lose my appetite and I immediately tossed my plate into a bus tub.  
My father and husband were up to eating there still. Since I wasn't eating, I asked both of them to rate their meal afterwards. My husband said that it was decent and my father said that his food was good.

Overall, the service was good and they had a nice variety of food here. But unfortunately, I couldn't try the food due to the earlier issues. I would recommend more vigorous methods of pest control and better exterior cleaning to improve guest satisfaction."

It was my first time there but I will be back. Me and my friend just returned from the Greenbelt after spending a long day at the river and we devoured plate after plate of delicious yummy food. All this for only $12.00.
Go for it!!!"
"GcCd6un-7tWsI1acY7Q6AQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"I'll just go ahead with being a fat ass and give my first five stars to a Chinese buffet.

I love the selection and there is barely a difference in the lunch and dinner menus. All I can remember is that they don't have the little seafood cup for lunch, which is a shame. It has a sweet mayonnaise layer on top of an assortment of octopus, shrimp, and vegetables. I think the flavors are amazing!

The quality seems top notch for a Chinese buffet, and because of the high traffic at this restaurant, the food is constantly fresh. I have yet to experience hardened fried rice or old soggy lo mein. 

I think that because of the Korean owners, there is a larger selection of Korean dishes. There is bulgogi (marinated sirloin strips), galbi (beef ribs), vegetable pancakes, and spicy chicken and vegetable soup (which is wayy too salty). 

I also really really like the marinated eggplant and the octopus salad. They have this sweet marinade which is actually very similar in flavor. 

The only thing that they are really lacking is the sushi. They only have rolls that are deep fried and smothered in spicy mayo. I guess if you like that stuff, you'll be in for a treat... but for true sushi lovers, it's a no-go. 

Overall, if you want to be a fat ass, GO!!"

"g7YExkPaBN7ZGsH3wmhWBA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"Not if you need clean utensils. Ma family and I went there lately. We asked for utensils (mostly knives to cut the food in smaller pieces for our kids). Long story short: we couldn't get any clean utensils. I asked the manager to come and see for herself. She said (her words): ""if you don't like it here, don't come back"", and she walked away. Fortunately, besides a little bit of chicken and white rice, my kids didn't like the food, so we could quickly wrap up and leave. For good. That tells me two things: hygiene is flat-out deficient, management not only couldn't care less about what you think, but won't hesitate to be rude even in front of children. Despicable."

main reason for going- korean bbq ribs. korean bbq ribs at a buffet?! i'm amazed. it wasn't the best i've had but IT'S KOREAN BBQ RIBS! i think it's a great deal considering the dinner buffet ran about $11. for the ribs alone, it pays for itself. the sushi i could have done without. the desserts weren't anything spectacular either. but hey, i'd go again! did i mention they have KOREAN BBQ RIBS?!"

I did it again today...went to Buffet Palace for lunch expecting better food that any of the other times I have been (isn't that the definition of insanity??)
The problem is the food *looks* good and it *looks* flavorful and interesting...then you take a bite or two and realize looks can be deceiving....bland, uninspired, over-cooked, rubbery....basically pretty gross.  I always leave feeling like I am on the verge of intestinal distress.
The only dish I know I will like is the jabchai...I should just get heaping plates of this...but I always end up torturing myself with 5 or six other dishes.
No matter how crazy I am to keep going to a restaurant that I basically don't like...I am sane enough to avoid raw fish here.   It doesn't even appear to be fresh...most of the sushi have a dried ""crust"" around the edges ~shiver~  If you must have sushi, stick with the seaweed rolls...they are actually not that bad.

I liked the cleanliness of this buffet (no sticky floors, table and plates were clean). The waiter was very attentive and kept our table plates free.

Trust me, i go crazy.......no self control oops. Anyways, the place seemed pretty packed, but there was no wait so that's a plus. The buffet did not have a huge selection since it wasn't particularly big like most buffets I'm used too, however their food felt just a little more quality than most buffets I've been too. I tried their korean bbq short ribs which I don't ever see in buffets so I was skeptical, but it was actually pretty good so I ate a few rounds of it. Their fried chicken wings were also crispy and not too oily and soggy. I also tried the lo mein, japchae, sushi, egg drop soup, and the curry. The lo mein was good but i felt like the noodles were soggy and maybe over cooked, sushi were ok (as expected for typical sushi in buffets), the egg drop soup was one of my favorite, and lastly the curry was very bland which wasn't as satisfying as i wanted it to be. I ended the dinner with some pineapples there and they were so fresh, juicy and sweet. Yeah, I did get into food coma right after if you were wondering haha. Anyways, there were plenty of other things I nicked and picked at and they were either a hit or miss, but overall I would come again.... not soon though, gotta let my belly relax!"

I tried a little of a lot of different things and I just couldn't find anything that didn't taste like either boiled cabbage with NO seasonings or like fried Styrafoam.

The chicken was all over cooked. The beef was kinda dry. The soup was not so good. I usually like their sushi rolls, but was disappointed today. The best thing to look forward to after your meal is the soft serve ice cream. The machine was broken. I say BOO!!"

"UhLxRXPBKfaJwGbHxeSs0A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Great option for buffet or takeout. Their party platter menu is so helpful when I am hosting a dinner and short on time. Most people think I made it myself (but I definitely admit that I didn't!). I usually do the chicken teriyaki + lomein from party platter menu. Staff is very friendly and quick to get catering platters prepared. May be a bit pricy but they are quick, consistent and quality.

Buffet has an array of options, for vegetarians too. It may not be the most authentic but it is always great quality food. Don't ever have to worry about getting sick from food being left out. Sometimes gets extremely busy but there is always food being replenished. 

I love this place and have been going since they opened years and years ago. 

Glad we have Asian buffet in south Austin."

The food at this location is definitely better with more variety than the other 2 previous locations.  I really enjoy the extra Korean side dishes like japchae, seaweed salads, and bean sprouts.  Grilled beef ribs, spicy crabs, rice noodles, eel sushi, and various tempura are also good.  Try the red bean sesame balls...so good!"

Literally the same food selections today as the first time I ate.  Is that bad?  Not really.  May as well stick to what you know best.  The sushi selection is decent and I enjoy the salads. 
The only reason why I haven't bumped up a star is dining room cleanliness is not always up to par.  Nothing horrible but vacated tables tend to sit awhile and it's not unusual to see napkins and stuff on the floor. Nothing to be alarmed of but just thought I mention that.  The food is great and I feel the quality hasn't changed at all so I'm glad for that"

I love the spinach and asian salads, variety of veggies and stir fries, eggplant, crab salad, soups, and soft serve ice cream!  My sister loves their sushi.  For a buffet, and I consider myself a connoisseur as I seek them out, it is better than most!  Good service and value, the best chinese buffet I've been to in any town actually, but always remember, it's a buffet so set your expectations accordingly."

They also have different items than other Asian buffets- Kimchi, octopus salad, pumpkin soup, bok choy in oyster sauce. If I had to choose an Asian buffet I would feel safe at this one. That is why I give it 4 stars. (And my stomach didn't feel icky after I ate it!)"

"Eh8t1MjtRjGbD2zP_tcV1A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"This is a good Chinese buffet. The quality is not sky high, but you know what you're getting when you go to a Chinese buffet-it's quantity over quality. There are some interesting things happening here that set them apart from other Chinese joints. For example, they have sushi, a lot of soups, a lot of cold vegetable dishes I've never seen anywhere else, a huge dessert selection, and an ice cream machine. My personal favorites are the rib steaks, Korean beef cakes, and the tempura veggies."
"2gdzx02VTvtkO58dn1pF6Q","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"I wrote a review of the other Buffet Palace before it burned to the ground earlier this year (may it rest in greasy peace).  I've also visited this location, and although this location is newer and nicer, I'm similarly unimpressed.

Lots of variety, including really-not-so-fresh sushi (you know when I refuse to eat sushi, it's bad); a slew of greasy Chinese dishes, usually a soup or two, and some tempura selections.  The tempura isn't so bad, nor are the potstickers - but why would you pay $10+ for a buffet and just eat potstickers and tempura?  I wouldn't.

I'm usually tempted to try the carmelized fried banana dessert, but about 60% of the time, you bite into it and the inside is cold, as if it were previously frozen and they didn't quite cook it long enough.

I usually reserve one-star reviews for (a) food poisoning or (b) when I'm truly angry about something, so I'm coughing up two stars for this place.  But seriously, people, go somewhere with GOOD Asian food and order one or two delicious dishes rather than spending your hard-earned cash on this crap.  Your taste buds and your stomach will thank you for it."

"EWEvbd0kfK7VuI1Z0pIqWA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Love this place

they always have great FRESH food and the price isn't expensive. 

One of the best parts about this restaurant is the sushi. I know what you are thinking...buffet sushi is nasty! Well not here. They make it fresh all day. After making made it and it being out between 1-2 hours, they toss it out in the trash and make more fresh. This keeps it good and tasty and it never smells like rotten fish! 
I also spoke with a cook and sushi chef outside the restaurant in my place of work across the street and they told me the same thing and offered to tell me anything I wanted to know about the cooking of the food. 

Hey they were honest and asked me to come back in. Try it out..I love it."
"_84jrkX-TX5rFuIIRYDc3A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"We used to come here a lot during high school and it was definitely one of the best places to go because of the wide variety and deliciousness.  However, I don't know if we grew up or if something really did happen that brought down the quality of the food served at Buffet Palace.  Now, post-college, my friends and I keep coming back out of habit, but it isn't the same.

The food sits out for a long time and only gets replenished when it is near-empty.  Sometimes it looks like some of the items have been sitting out a while - especially where the sushi is located.  We used to get tons of sushi there, but have all since veered away from it because a few of us have had unpleasant experiences afterwards which seemed to lead back to the sushi.  But that's a risk you take with any sushi, I'm sure.

They do have good tempura and korean BBQ ribs.  I'm also a fan of being able to choose from a wide variety of options.  The soups aren't too bad.  The soft serve at the end of the night is always a nice touch.

Now we go as more of a nostalgia thing, but would I take my friends or family there today?  Probably not unless they were begging to go or we had a lot of picky people to please."
"MYkglN_lBc0I2ZxaOGZtdg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"This restaurant has different owners from the original Buffet Palace that burned to the ground off 183 and Lamar. I am surprised at all of the low ratings because this place is my new favorite Asian buffet in all of Austin. My girlfriend's favorite is Buffet King but even she loved this place. The cold salad side of the semi-circle buffet was nothing short of impressive. I filled my plate on this side alone before I knew it and they had the largest sushi selection I personally have seen at a buffet in recent years. The hot side of the buffet had the average standards but also surprised me with several specialty selections. If you rated this restaurant low in the past, I strongly suggest you give it another shot."

(in bed)"
"IFa09KyfmKbPmXw8L6kVoQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"1. The best Chinese food I've ever had was in a two-story hovel in some back alley in Taipei. The natives with me took me there after I asked, ""Where's the best Chinese food in this town?"" 

2. Do I expect the same experience and doe-eyed amazement at a Chinese buffet deep in the heart of Texas? Uh, no, Sherlock.  (But wouldn't it make Austin that much more interesting if it ever did happen?)

3. So accepting Buffet Palace for what it is--a huge, Asian-influenced American-style smorgasbord that's reasonably priced with lots of open airy seating--I'm kind of hard-pressed to think of reasons why this isn't as good as it gets. I mean really, compared to what? 

4. For me, the best thing about buffets is not seeing a ten-year-old sneeze on the entrees. With that in mind, when the colleagues and I have time to kill and want lots of food cheap, Buffet Palace is a place we frequent.  

5. I like staying on the cold side, the one with the fresh spring rolls, shrimp, chilled noodle salads, etc.--I just ignore the rule that says buffet patrons must consume vast quantities of deep-fried breaded goo with quarts of fried rice. And actually, that's why I think Buffet Palace rates five stars--you can eat light and well there, or you can eat all the crap you want, or you can whine how fourth helpings aren't as good as the first, and everyone in the place will still be smiling and pleasant with you."
"7r1X8qQks8p9u9e2yTFClQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I have been wanting to check this place out and we've been to here twice now. 
The first time was before a late movie, around 9:00pm and the sushi was clearly only dregs, but there was plenty of other stuff despite the hour. 

I like the fact that it is pan Asian with a combination of Korean, Japanese and Chinese food. In reality it is a bastardized version of all of them that caters to American taste buds, but I was expecting that.

Now to the good stuff. The ""seafood dynamite"" in a little tin shot glass is a great invention! It is cheesy creamy sauce with a mix of shrimp and seafood. They have Kim Chi, spicy Korean dishes and Korean ribs. All good.

There was more sushi the second time we came, around 7:00pm and it is probably a good thing that they have no actual raw fish, just California rolls, eel, cooked shrimp and the like. They have decent miso soup.

There were a lot of options, from breaded shrimp to what looked like baked shrimp, to breaded stir fry chicken, clams, etc. something for everyone.

They have a self-serve ice cream machine, which gives that icy style of chocolate or vanilla, which I like because the flavor is good, but it's not killer sugar.

The desert area was overkill, but great mini cakes and smaller servings of appealing sweets, so you can taste several things.

The service was minimal, but friendly. This place is great for eating a variety of Asian-like food when you're not looking for a gourmet experience. I'm sure we'll return."
"4O7FqiraH0AEtQS1ipEsYQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"yet it is the best, most delicious buffet I've seen in America !! there are Chinese, Korean and Japanese cuisine!"
"OUe_qEKdrM5W-Gqhf3F26w","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"The term ""buffet"" is usually associated with a mediocre experience at best, and food that makes McDonalds seem like a lavish treat.

That being said Buffet Palace was pretty damn good for an $8 meal. I ended up having 3 fully loaded plates and a few slices of cheesecake to top it all off afterwards. Not bad for shy of 10 bucks!

Today has been an especially slow and tiresome day at work so a coworker said ""lets go to the buffet"" ..of course I cringed, but after a few korean short ribs, a scoop of orange shrimp, and some quickly thrown together sushi - I'M A BELIEVER!

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a very filling experience without emptying your wallet too badly.

The foods by no means award winning, but it sure beats fast food, and they have a good variety to choose from."

Food.  Honestly, it's not a huge buffet. Unlike a lot of buffets, there's also a lot of non-Chinese dishes.  There's a good selection of sushi. (Mom liked the avocado roll, especially.)  There's a bunch of Korean too.  (Mom also liked the Korean vegetable pancakes.)  I liked the sesame chicken and the sweet and sour chicken.  I'd have liked to have seen some of my other Americanized Chinese favorites, like orange chicken or General Tso's chicken.  There were potstickers on the buffet as well.  Of course, since they're potstickers, by default, they're automatically good.  But honestly, they'd spent a little too much time on the buffet itself.

Buffet itself.  One thing I really liked was how there were plenty of sauces nearby the relevant dishes.  Also, there was an area with other condiments.  Like I said earlier, unlike any other buffet in town, there's less Americanized Chinese options and more Korean options.  The buffet suffers from a lack of cleaning, though.

Service. Sporadic at best. Several issues with getting drinks refilled, plates cleared, and getting some hot tea for one of our group.

All in all, it's not bad for a buffet.  And if you find stuff you like on the buffet, it can be very good."
"DSSNGcLl3-yX2Ij8KYUO1g","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Okay, I admit that I'm a buffet junkie. After having plowed my way through Chinese buffets that offer greasy, bland food that tastes the same from one dish to another, it's a pleasure to find Buffet Palace.

They have a decent selection of sushi; I've tried most of the rolls and they're very good and this coming from one who doesn't care much for sushi or seafood in general. There's an extensive selection of salads which you may be tempted to pass by--don't! They usually make a mean spring roll with an excellent peanut sauce for dipping but on this visit they consisted almost entirely of lettuce which was bitter. For the hot dishes you'll find what you've come to expect at most Oriental buffets and then some. There's tempura (not always crisp, but tasty) excellent pot stickers and a General Tso's Chicken that's on par with a menu-only restaurant; also, the pineapple pork was quite good. Add to that very good service and reasonable prices, and you've got a winner.

If you're in South Austin, give them a try; I think you'll be glad you did!

"09d8tDXA0o4bKBjo2ziK5w","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"There was a North location at one time on Anderson Sq., but it burned to the ground. I happened to be in that neighborhood while it was happening and I SAW it, and it literally BURNED TO THE GROUND! Absolutely nothing left. Lucky for me I live South anyway.

I like this place. They have probably the largest buffet selection of any Chinese buffet I've been to. There are DOZENS of items to select from.

They have all the regular Chinese dishes you'd expect, and a very extensive Sushi selection as well.  Me, I'm not a Sushi fan, but I have friends who like the quality, and REALLY like the fact that you can get a lot more food than you can at a ""by-the-plate"" restaurant.  OK, so it's not ""Uchi quality"", or so I would expect. I dunno cuz like I said, I don't care for Sushi. But for what you'd spend at Uchi for one meal, for a decent amount of food, you could eat ALL WEEK at BP . If you can afford Uchi, try 'em. Then go to BP at least ONCE & compare. That goes as well for any of you who've already been to Uchi. Try BP at least once; just wear a disguise so you won't be ""seen"". Anyone tries both, PLEASE WRITE ME; I'd like to know, from a Sushi aficionado, how they feel about it.

BP doesn't list PRICES on their 'site, but I sorta disagree with the $$ overall rating they get. That might be true for dinner (barely) but I usually go for lunch, and not including a glass of iced tea, the buffet itself is UNDER $10.  

I've tried many items (but not everything). Of my tastings, the only things I really didn't care for were: the Spicy Seafood Soup. Broth and vegetables were tasty, but gave up on peeling the shrimp or getting any meat out of the tiny crabs. And messy; had to wash my hands before continuing. Just take shrimp and crab out cuz the soup is great, and you still get the flavor from them. And, some Korean concoction that was in a red garlic sauce; NO, not at all! Sauce was very pasty and it really didn't have much flavor to me. 

I didn't make notes on what all I had, never do. Next time I go, I WILL make a list and give more of a ""bite-by-bite"" accounting of each dish in an update.

If BP were a sit-down, full-service restaurant, with a more limited selection, I might give a lower rating than what I give here. But for those who've read some of my other reviews, I take into account what a given restaurant is TRYING TO BE & in this case factoring in the sheer number of dishes and OVERALL quality (hey, can YOU simultaneously prepare maybe 30-40 items and have them ALL come out satisfactory?). 

If a place has poor decor but the food and service are good, they're gonna get a higher rating than a really fancy place that has poor food, bad service, or both. Perry's Steakhouse? I gave 'em 5 Stars; they're upscale and very expensive, and they've EXCELLENT. That's what they're TRYING to be, and they've succeeded. Tucci's Southside Subs is obviously a sub shop. Not much in the way of decor, fairly inexpensive, and I gave them 5 Stars; they're not trying to be Perry's, just a plain ol' sub shop that serves the best sub in Austin, and THEY'VE succeeded. THEY are excellent. They're BOTH 5 Star places, even though price and decor are different. I've already got reviews posted for them, and as you can tell I try to give a detailed review as to WHY I like/dislike a place. I can't stop at: ""The food was good"" or ""the food was bad"". That's not even worth the time to write (or read). I've been to most of the Chinese buffets down south. Most are OK, one is really not very good; Buffet Palace is head-and-shoulders above them ALL.

I recommend Buffet Palace, especially if you live close by. BTW, they also have a location in Killeen, near Ft. Hood. Go check 'em out. NOW!

BTW, I recommend staying AWAY from the other BP, er, I mean BRITISH Petroleum. But that's just ME...

Not a whole lot of 'Chinese' food imo, but there are several soups and a pretty wide variety of desserts to choose from as well. If you like sushi and eat a lot of it, it's worth the $11- if you're looking for a more Americanized Chinese buffet, you may not like this one as well as some of the others in town."

Pretty decent asian buffet. It is quite clean and food is kept full for lunch. I've only been here once and for $9.75, it's a fair deal. I was a little disappointed to not see the seafood mini pie or kalbi beef short ribs available like in previous pictures. ..maybe it's a dinner thing or from a few years ago? They have a wide selection of food. Many were salads and fried foods. I didn't try the fried small shrimp or diy lemon etc sauce for breaded chicken. They had about 6 soups too. And many stir fry dishes.

Japanese food: 3* lack sushi selection. Had edamame, miso soup, tofu, veg  tempura and teriyaki chicken.

Chinese food:4*
It actually looks more appetizing than numerous Chinese restaurants I searched through Yelp. (I have yet to try a Chinese restaurant here in Austin..as a recent transplant from norcal). 

Korean food: 3*
Some were better than others. 
-kimchi: nice kick just how it should be
-cucumber in chili: not flavored enough in chili paste. Prob needed to sit longer to 'pickle' and absorb flavor
-jap chae: done decent. Hint sesame oil. Noodles cooked perfectly
-korean pancake and fried dumpling: pancake little doughy. The dumpling was good and had decent amount of meat
-beef bulgogi (? ): resembled cooked on stove top and in its liquid. Taste alright. Mild flavor
-pork: 2* didn't care for it. Need more seasoning
-kimbap: glad they offer it but I like the yellow and brown veggies in it. I only saw the yellow. Thought it was alright. 3*

-chow mein: surprisingly good. Liked the slight chewiness of the noodle.
-egg roll vegetarian only: outside was fried well but the cabbage inside was plain and salty. 
-fried rice: perfect consistency and no overly doused in soy sauce.
-stir fry egg w zuchinni and shrimp w hot sauce: tasty on top on fried rice since I love scrambled eggs. Not too much hot sauce either which is good
-beef w broccoli: actually taste oyster sauce but beef isn't the most tender. Broccoli crisp.
-sesame chicken and .. (?): there were 2 kinds of breaded and sauced chicken. Both were tasty. Americanized Chinese which is fine. 
-had veg tempura only ...no shrimp. So I didn't try it.
-teriyaki chicken: done very well. Nice teriyaki flavor 
-chicken curry: really good. Coconut yellow curry with a kick of heat. Went well w spoonful of white rice. It had bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, tender chicken breast slices and baby corn.
-sushi: pretty much all cali roll. Didn't see raw fish. Was either topped with imitation crab or shrimp. 2.5/5* tasted fine nothing to rave.
-tried a spoonful of pumpkin porridge which is different. It was sweeter than expected since it sat next to miso soup.

Dessert
-surprisingly good dessert for an asian buffet. They had banana pudding, peach cobbler, biscuits, orange, pineapple, 4 cakes (carrot, mango swirl, strawberry swirl, lemon coconut cream) and 2 cookies (almond and choc chip). And of course they had soft serve. They choc actually tasted like chocolate. I tried the carrot which was moist with a nice cream cheese frosting. The almond cookie was crisp almost like a danish cookie in a good way with bits of almond. The coconut lemon icing was tasty but the yellow cake below was okay. Soft serve vanilla was fine.

I'd def be back. I'd say the strong points are there hot food items, salad area and decent dessert. I feel the sushi could use improvement but they prob would need to raise costs to pay for sushi grade fish."
"iSeHOHPVCfVfiFGbNcPYpg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Usually go here for Chinese buffet, and it hits the spot most times. The sushi is so so, but what do you expect from an all you can eat place? The noodles and fried rice are the best, and everything else is just filler. 

Great place to save an appetite for, but not a date place."
"iajn4T_9Atr84G2ZmWQBOA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"OK, so after my initial review I was contacted by the manager via Yelp and was told that they do not serve the Spicy Chicken soup on the weekends.

So let me share this:  I no longer live in South Austin, I had called in ahead to see if they serve this soup - the man on the phone left and came back and said they had it there.  The soup had a tag on it reading it was Spicy Chicken soup but the manager just confirmed the reason I did not see any chicken in this soup but tofu was because - they do not serve it on the weekends and it was seafood soup!  

Did I mention this was my birthday meal?   So, yeah - I drove over an hour to get this soup which I confirmed on the phone was being served when it turns out that it was not the soup as labeled and the person who I spoke with on the phone was not honest or did not see Tofu instead of Chicken....

Not good customer service at all.. shame shame shame on you!"
"XVI2BwF66xdQPTMscuF-dg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I love this place. My wife and I eat here often. There is a very good selection of various Asian cuisine: Chinese, Korean and Japanese. The sushi is usually pretty good. I particularly like the potstickers and the bulgogi beef. Hmmm, now I'm getting hungry. :)"

I'm not a dessert fan, but they have some lightly sweet treats that make me steal a bite from the wife. Beats the hell out of your average Asian buffet."
"aDR5zuXpOXGsBbi5kRRGgw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"I think if it's not a gourmet buffet the best quality is going to be the variety. And there were a lot of options here. Jalapeno chicken, which I don't think sounds too Asian but I liked it anyhow. Some stuff wasn't great and some was a little above average. The teriyaki chicken seemed extra salty but was not greasy like a lot of the other stuff, which I appreciated.

There were a LOT of desserts, which is always awesome at a buffet. The cakes were cut into reasonable pieces, too, so you don't have to feel like a jerk for taking a piece and not finishing it all.

The waitress we had constantly filled our waters and took away the plates quickly. They don't just fill drinks, they take the dirty plates so you don't have a table full of 4 empty plates at the end.... and, you know, they're trying to earn a living too. So do tip them. :)"
"OCf1aFvezvK1R1UtIFm8rQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"Usually good food, but horribly dirty. I have eating there throughout the years and it's always been good, but I went in today and I left within five minutes of being seated. The floors had sticky spots and food all over them, the booth where I was seated had leftover food pieces, the table was sticky, and the bathroom had water on the floor with no wet floor sign, a clogged toilet, and no soap. If this is how the section of the restaurant where the GUESTS are looks like, I cannot even imagine the state of kitchen. Disappointing and disgusting."
"9XtU3Ol9knl5SKRI_wfuUA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"So, I'm a little upset my latest reviews have been through chains. This week has been so stressful.

With that aside, the food here is eadible and they have Pepsi. :)
They did have a few things that other Chinese buffets do not. Sushi, different cooked seafood, Pho, a handful of different salads, a lot of desserts... Dare I say I was impressed by their selection? 

I tried the sushi, dumplings, spicy blue crab, mussels, crab wontons, salmon, beef and brocolli. That plate was the adventurous side of me, but kind of gross.

Another plate consisted of the ""usual American take"" of sweet&sour chicken, sesame chicken, white rice with soy sauce. Again, I was anything but satisfied.

Dessert was dry strawberry cake, dry green tea cake, and mushy fried bananas w/ caramel sauce. 

Buffet Palace is a buffet. Period, end of story. Nothing more. I didn't expect great food. It's a BUFFET. What I am walking out with is a stomach that is full of food. Not memorable, but not horrible."
"UKZZk20Cy7E59YFkEeDOZQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"this place is ok. Iv been a few times, and its usually a ""hit or miss"". Recently, I bought a groupon for a discounted price and used it last week, but I was surprised to see they raised the price. I went with my little boy, and the bill was more than it used to be. The buffet price is now at about $13 each. I dont plan to eat here anymore, its just not worth it to me for the quality level of food. ( my personal opinion). I think they put alot of msg in the food because both myself and my son got super full off like 2 bites, never going back for seconds, which is good.. however not for $13! lol. id rather order a better tasting plate for $8 from my fav lil chinese spot thats not a buffet."
"ELOA6DuYr_pw35EaqeWl9A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"The food is good BUT the waitress made me confused when she told me that I HAVE TO WEAR UNIFORM TO GET MILITARY DISCOUNT.

"9LKmp5gnEDrKT0upyRXZbA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"Went there for the 1st time with my husband,mother, and 3 month old daughter. I will never go back. I aksed for a high chair and the waitor told me I could not have a high chair at a booth, never once had my drink refilled and we were there for an hour. Food was cold even under the lights, and the buffett was dirty. I went to the restroom and there were mouse traps visible and there were 2 toilets out or order. The service horrible, restruant filthy, and food not so good. Will NEVER go back."
"6SilLLk2cTf59nkxobV4oQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Good variety on the buffet.

"gRYM3_8e3TGYVUrO66mgIg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"It's been a while since I've had buffet so magnificent,  I pee'd my pants.  

From the scrumptious Crab Rangoons that taste like crab and not just cream cheese, to the soft shell blue crab and stupendous curry chicken. 

I have to say, though.....the Sushi let me down. But the soups....to die for!

I gained twenty pounds, but it was well worth it."
"RJJgiUCSOtie2XNhCxNWZg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"can't complain for 10.95 plus tax for dinner. food is okay and there are plenty of sushi varieties. however theres not the greatest variety and they didn't have my favorite..snow crab legs! just average"
"_o6TpcYKLSZFBhm6cBlLxg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"I am amazed at the mix of reviews for this place. There is however in my opinion a simple formula for navigating Buffet Palace. 

1. Go when its busy. Lunch or dinner rush. Honestly, you probably don't want the food (especially the sushi) thats sitting there at say 2:30 in the afternoon.

2. For the dumplings and the veggie cakes - Watch the guy on the griddle. When he is cooking, immediately get the food as soon as its cooked. Its A- material

3. Look for fresh food. Don't scrape the bottom of the pans like its your last meal on earth. 

My favorites include the following:

Spicy salmon roll. 
Spicy tuna roll
Dumplings 
Veggie cakes - Best I ever had todays visit
Spinach/cabbage salad with spicy dressing
Spring rolls - Shrimp today packed with cilantro goodness
Mussels Dynamite - Again look for fresh trays; not 3 hour old mussels
Shrimp with walnuts
Long beans

If you notice, I try and stick with the healthier (almost) options. I very rarely hit the Sesame or General Tso's bandwagon. With a few tips and lessons from the just now self appointed ""buffet master""; dining here just got a little bit better. I'm patting myself on the back right now : )"
"1GDqREpYGZnCHyolOb23DA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I haven't been to another Chinese buffet for the price and quality of this one. They always have fresh sushi and hot food! What more can you ask for?"
"UtBVAze1bOASR_1tsUeLPA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"It is more expensive than most places I go to, but it's all-you-can-eat seafood, so I can live with that. I'm a fan of buffets and I like all levels of Asian and Asian-inspired food (panda express, home-made by a native, fancy sushi place...). I love the crab and shrimp items, the standards like orange or sesame chicken, all the veggies, and the sushi. Go here when you're really hungry and in the mood for saucy delicious-ness."
"b_Z5TuhmTr2dcWfjUgQk8A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Only if the dishes are clean. Leftover food on dishes that is quite obvious. And it happens every time I come to eat. Some QA on dishwashing is necessary."
"2veBhSYIGwtmxbUk7a4Ftw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Had passed this place a few times, and finally decided that it was time to try it. Upon entering, you notice right away that the buffet isn't set up like a normal Chinese buffet. The dining areas almost feel more like a cafeteria then a restaurant, but this didn't bother me much. I love that the benches along the edge of the dining area have full panels between benches for almost complete privacy. The food wasn't bad to say the least- I've been to a lot of Chinese buffets in my time, and this was definitely on the higher side as far as quality. I've been twice, and this last time we arrived about an hour before closing- we left about 15 minutes prior, and they were still putting fresh dishes out...impressive, as any buffet I've ever been to stops serving fresh food no less then 45 minutes before the doors close. I really like the orange shrimp and pot stickers here, and their sushi selection isn't bad for a buffet. They are quick about getting dirty plates off your table and are courteous and friendly enough. I plan on going back and taking friends with me as well!"
"ADDiZ3nno5A8BiETPP3ODA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"Don't bother with the Chinese food, it's drenched in salt laden sauce and grease. 
And stay FAR away from the mac and cheese and quesadillas. Why would they even have these?? 
  
Do however get the Korean food. The owners of Buffet Palace are Korean and it seems that the Korean food here is more authentic. My favorite was the octopus salad and the jap chae. The short ribs were okay, you can tell that they don't use high quality meat, but the charred and marinated flavor on them is pretty good. The seafood tofu soup was surprisingly not bad, with tiny chunks of seafood and a nice spicy broth. 

The sushi was eh...I really don't have high expectations for sushi at a buffet place like this. The dessert section was very eh....

Overall, I would just come here to pig out on Korean food, but not without a groupon.  It is definitely not worth it to come here without one, especially on weekends,"
"1CJ2D47lJRCLdB80tD-ntw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I have yet to find an exceptional Chinese buffet in any town I've ever lived or visited.  But I like Buffet Palace because they have such a variety of foods, and most things that people would enjoy trying if they've never had it before.  Not too many things are scary here with legs poking out of fried batter.  They have 4-5 soups, tons of sushi rolls, a variety of vegetable and meat dishes (including fish), and lots of fruits and desserts.  It's hella expensive on the weekends, though, at $11.50/person.  I guess I just don't eat enough at a buffet to warrant an $11.50 tab, but it's a nice alternative from time to time."

This fun-for-the-fat-family establishment isn't bad - for 8 bucks or so you can sit there and gorge, gorge, gorge. I've tried to approach it the healthy way, eating greens and fruit,,blahblahblah...but it just seems pointless. 

You're going to leave feeling like a whale. 

And possibly a sick one.

According to Austin's newest restaurant guide, Buffet Palace failed three health inspections in a row before the book's publication.

Seeing buffet-style sushi sitting for long periods of time, under lamps, it's not hard to figure out why. I can't always deny the gorge-association  from the two large (fat) statues standing outside when I'm around Westgate, but if I need to take care of myself, I find it best to resist temptation. The quick fix comes with consequences."

I really enjoy the large selections of fresh banchan (kimchi, seasoned bean sprouts, seaweed leaves, etc) available on the buffet as well as the galbi, tempura, and seafood pancakes.

            I grabbed my first plate and sat down to eat. As i was eating my noodles there was a BUG in my food. An INSECT in my food. I was absolutely disgusted and spat out my food. We asked for a manager to inform about the BUG in my food, however, she had absolutely no sincerity in her response. She didn't apologize and simply offered a compensation. She said we won't charge you for your food so enjoy the rest of your meal as if I complained in order to receive some kind of compensation. For the rest of the meal, I didn't take another bite of their food. 
           Keep in mind, i went out for dinner with my family and the rest of them were disgusted as well. They played around with their food a little and then went for dessert. 
          I usually don't complain about a piece of hair, however a BUG is a different story. I understand a BUG could sneak in once in a while i guess but the way they approached the situation is what brought me to complain."

There is the typical Chinese buffet fare, such as fried rice, lo mein, and General Tso's chicken, but something that makes Buffet Palace so much more interesting is the fact that they offer (decent to good) sushi and Korean food.

The Korean food is mostly typical food, like japchae and galbi, and even though I'm not entirely sure their sushi ideas were conceived in-house or not, they're certainly special - the Texan Roll has a piece of chicken and blueberry sauce on it, and the Crunchy Spicy Roll has Hot Cheetos crushed on top. Pretty classy, right?

Regardless of their questionable sushi fillings and toppings (which I am guilty of liking), the food is constantly replenished, the servers are pleasant, and, probably most importantly of all, the place is bright and clean. I've been to my fair share of dimly lit buffets with sticky tables, and they remind me why people have a bad impression of them.

Do keep in mind that this isn't the most authentic or mind-blowing Chinese food - you're at a Chinese buffet, after all. Buffet Palace does manage to strike a great balance of quantity and quality, though, all at a decent price ($13).

I have been here probably 5 times or so and have been pleasantly surprised by the food each time and impressed by the service.  I love the sushi roll bar they have.  There are always 5-8 or so different rolls to choose from.  They have several Asian salads and soups to choose from.  Plus there at at least 10-20 different other Asian main courses.  One of my favorites was the yellow curry chicken, it was so creamy and delicious.  There the desert you have tons of choices as well, everything from any sort of cake to pudding to soft serve ice cream.  

The restaurant is pretty big and clean.  The bars are kept clean as well.  The service is awesome, as soon as you finish a plate and get up for another one the dirty one is gone.  If your drink is close to being half gone it is filled up swiftly almost without you noticing.

This is the first buffet I've ever been to that serves kalbi (korean short ribs), pork belly, and japchae (Korean clear noodles). Not to mention, they're pretty delicious too. They have a good variety of sushi rolls, and I usually ask a worker if I can have a side of spicy mayo which makes all the sushi rolls taste delicious. I would stay away from their hot and sour soup because it'll ruin your appetite.

If you are fan of Sushi, this is a place for you. I had been to the Buffet Palace a few times previously. I could not remember why I hesitated going in this time. After lunch today I completely understand why. First of all, there was a moderate amount of customer traffic. They did attempt to keep the dishes full. There was a guy who was BBQing ribs. I opted for Lo Mein and fried rice. The Lo Mein had a funny taste to it. I was very disappointed there was not any General Tso's chicken or beef with garlic sauce. The only options for spicy was Kung Pao chicken and japaleno chicken. I did opt for sweet and sour chicken; but, it was too greasy. 

I did not go for the soup. I was already having a bad experience with the lack of options and the food quality. The service was good. The server did keep our glasses full. For over $40+ for 3 adults was a bit overpriced. I do not eat sushi, nor am I a fan of it. You are pretty much paying for the sushi they have out.

I thought everything was great except for the grilled veggies, they were just too smoky tasting, yuck. I mean, I really, really liked the food. I just didn't like getting shoved aside at the door by one of the staff. I tipped my waitress, she did her job just fine."
"n5E6Wh-Wdw6mfT5gbLNK5g","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"The food was good but whatever you do don't eat the sushi. I didn't even make it out of the restaurant when I immediately had to go to the bathroom. I'll withhold the unfortunate details of what went on in the restroom. I love sushi and had never gotten sick from it but if this review can help at least one person avoid being in my situation  it would suffice."
"i1D3RXEdHKC3YNh5ZuCOmg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I moved to Austin the summer of 2006 and this was probably one of the first Chinese buffet's I went to.  That said, I went here for lunch recently for the first time since then.  That should tell you what I thought of it.  Anyway, years have gone by and suddenly I see it's the 'Best in Austin' for years straight and friends are talking about how great it was.  I guess it was worth another shot.  First off, this place is BUSY.  The parking lot and the food lines are akin to driving in the Fiesta parking lot (either one will do as they both are pretty much packed with horrible drivers).  The interior decor is actually somewhat tasteful and lots of natural light.  Lunch buffet was $8.50!  They have a TON of choices, TON!  I started off with their 'sushi' rolls.  They had all kinds of weirdness that I've A. Never seen.  B. Would NEVER thought of.  They had one roll that was topped with spicy Cheetos!  CHEETOS ON A ROLL!  I ate pretty much my whole plate of weird sushi rolls and enjoyed them about as much as you can at an all you can eat ""Chinese"" buffet.  Don't you look at me that way!  I then moved onto the hot food.  I had some Generals chicken and terriyaki.  The General's was OK and the Terriyaki was actually pretty good.  Kinda like the stuff you get from the mall food court.  I say that in the best way possible.  Who doesn't like a giant to-go box stuffed with fried rice and grilled chicken slathered in sauce for $6-7!?!?  I think from there I tried their beef and pork bulgogi.  I've had the pork version at a real Korean place and LOVED it.  This stuff?  It was pretty damn gross.  I had a couple of bites and probably made the same face you did about the spicy cheeto rolls and pushed it aside.  The beef version was freaking GOOD!  Their eggrolls, crab rangoons and all that jazz was just OK.  Also big props for tempura veggies.  That was boss.  All in all, the best?  Probably not.  Bad*ss for $8.50?  Heck yeah!"
"sH2T7Ve0Bif10Z7MEobWFg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"The price is about $15 per person at dinner time, which is reasonable considering their range of food choices. This is indeed a mix of American-Asian food: Chinese stir-fried dishes, Korean salads, sushi and common desserts. Don't expect any of these to be authentic.
Personally I think they have better sushi, more soup but less meat options than most of the Asian buffets I've tried. I like their boiled shrimp and buttered sweet corn. Good oranges and pineapples. In short, a OK and convenient place but not attractive."
"6V7I5IcNT_mIvLq_3IvyZA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"Nice place, good food, good service. Love all the sushi available. But went in with me, my husband, 3 year old, and an infant car seat and we were sat at a table- sounds ok but when I asked for a booth because of the car seat the host said oh it'll be ok on the chair.... Umm ok. And then only gave us 2 silver wear and when I asked for a third she said he's eating too? As if 3 year olds don't eat -or at least pick off my plate or want deserts. And then charged us for 3 adults when I guess my 3 year old looks over 10...? Just saying."

Austin. I visited the West Gate location on Sunday and the food was horrible. Every item I chose was at room temperature or colder. Everything minus the fried rice. Can't beat their rice but at just under 15.00 dollars the quality was lacking. Well apparently the restaurant is no longer owned and managed by the original owners but has been bought by a young group of people who are trying to squeeze every penny they can thus the low quality meats and poor preparation. I truly hope that they get it together for old times sake."

Then some time later my roommate told me this place didn't score so good with the Health inspection people and that we weren't going back there. Once I found that out I though ewww.

There's also side dishes and Korean soups.

This has happened many times over the past year of visits. It's really become obscure to keep spending money at an establishment that can't keep consistency.

Lunch is priced at $13.99 on the weekends ( $9.75 weekdays ). Yes, they have quite a variety. I was Ono to try their kalbi ( although the wife warned they weren't as good as hers ) and they do have quite a selection of food. Most did not really have taste ( even with the sauces provided it was still kinda- eh ). But everybody has different taste. The dessert section was small. Thank goodness it wasn't crowded when we were there as I can imagine how noisy this place could become.

When my niece spoke to the manager just before we walked out the door, the manager told her that if HE had been aware we were there when we came in, he would have refused to seat us because Sundays are busy and seeing a dog would have upset the other customers. He pointed out a sign on the door stating that no dogs were allowed. Seriously? These people are clearly uninformed on the law. They'll never get our business again.

"EjLQ4hBYJCF0cZzJ5DeASg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"FOUND CIGARETTE BUTT IN FOOD

No joke! On ocassion, after a night of partying, I like to satisfy my inner fat kid. My lady friend and I decided chinese buffet would hit the spot. Ive eaten there a few times and I know what Im getting into when I go. After I grabbed my second plate I picked at the curry and the broccoli/beef I had on my plate. Thats when I found it. Immediately I thought, that looks like a cigerette butt, but quickly brushed it off thinking, no kitchen is really THAT dirty; thats only in movies right? I picked it up, inspected it, and it 100% without a doubt was a cigerette butt. Im not a complainer really with food. I work service industry as well and understand bugs get into food sometimes. Ive still eaten plates without notifying my server at all. Im genuily not bothered much by it. But this is a f&@$ing cigarette butt.

Ok. I found it. Believe it or not, it gets better (worse)...

I ask for a manager and an employee brings me this older asian lady. I think her nametag said Yon. I show her what I found, and she picks it up, says 'oh what is that?' as she's peeling it apart, exposing the filter inside. Its a cigerette butt, duh. I tell her where I found it, and she nonchalantly says, 'oh Im so sorry,' pats me on the back and walks away. Shocked at such an uninterested response, I say 'but Im not done with you...' I wasnt trying to be mean, but I guess my brain decided that needed to be said. Anyway, I find our server, tip her and say thanks. It wasnt her fault. She actually was great. She kept the sodas and waters flowing and made us laugh. She could probably tell we were hungover. I think her name was Ann? Anna? Very sweet. Manager finally comes back and says 'Im so sorry. I only charge you for one.' To which my brain, again spoke out of instinct, said 'No we're not paying for this at all. Thats disgusting!' as we got up and left. Im still in shock about how the manager handled the situation. I felt I was being overly polite by not making a scene whatsoever. At my job people would be fired on the spot for something so... gross? unprofessional? unsanitary? rude? and every other synonym you can find in the thesaurus for those words.

This whole time Ive been completely dumbfounded as to how it even got inside the food. It was crushed as if it was stepped on. How did it get from being stepped on on the floor, hopefully from outside the building, to inside the food? Do they smoke in the kitchen? But then how did it even get off the ground and into the food? Do they let their kitchen supplies sit on the ground while theyre cooking? Inside and outside? My only conclusions are freak accident or malicious intent. Either way, I deserved more than a condescending pat on the back and ONE free meal.

TL;DR Found cigarette butt in food. Manager brushed it off and said she'd charge us for only one buffet instead of two."

I love it when they do the crab leg special...such a deal!

Monday nights young children are free and the ones a little older are half price. I didn't realize that until I got an incredibly low bill at the end of our meal. When I asked about it I found out about the Monday night special - wow!

It's the sort of place you leave feeling awful though - it's a ""pleasant sort of awful"" if you just do it once in awhile. :)"
"HArDRjWGA_FHLN2ED6s72w","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Good stuff.

On lucky nights, there's a good selection of sashimi-topped rolls. Generally the sushi is pretty fresh.

There's wonderful crawfish (which I once downed 85 of. that was probably a bit too much), in a spicy and flavorful boil broth.

And lots of good Chinese stir-fry, Korean BBQ, and of course the obligatory pepperoni pizza for the kiddies. Sometimes also quesadillas!

One big hit here: my friends love it, though I'm not all that into dessert - it's the Chinese-style fried donut (round), which you dump into one of the round soup-bowls, and then smother with a serving of vanilla soft-serve. The hot crispiness of the donut, juxtaposed with the creamy, sweet, cold soft-serve, is pretty killer, even to my un-dessert-trained palate. My friends sometimes get 10 servings of this, I kid you not, and that on top of a regular meal.

Best part? The price is amazingly low. $7.95 for lunch, $10.95 for dinner. Can't beat that with a stick.

This place is definitely one of the top 10 favorite restaurants for my friends and I, due to all of the above."

-The wonton was not very good. Overcooked sitting in the broth. Wish they had it on the side or had someone makes them to order like my fave buffet back at home.
-not so good: sushi still lacking in ingredients and variety. No raw fish at all. green beans alright. 2.5/5* not horrible but had a lot better. Not crisp fried. Tossed in chili oil sauce. Wish just had salt and pepper. Still don't like veggie egg rolls..they should chop cabbage more and add seasoning not just what tastes like salt. Wish it had pork.

It's not cheap, the selection can be downright strange sometimes, the food is far from fresh, most of it is deep fried.  I do enjoy the potstickers, the fried rice isn't bad, the sushi is freaking scary (I mean who would really eat sushi here, wtf?).  All it has going for it is that you can eat all the garbage you wan't, puke it up and do it all over again.

All their food is perfectly edible and at least decent enough to eat (which already puts it a whole league over just about any other Chinese buffet in Austin) and they even have some surprise hits like their sushi, which is the best buffet sushi I've had outside of an actual sushi buffet. The biggest problem is the menu itself; this is a Chinese restaurant with no orange chicken or general Tso chicken, but somehow it has orange shrimp, an elaborate salad bar that takes up a quarter of the buffet, and 8 different kinds of sushi. Oh, and that sushi drives the price of this place up like crazy, as dinner costs like 13 bucks before tax. If you're fiending for all you can eat Asian food and don't have the wallet for Sushi Junai, give it a go, but don't expect to become a regular."

BUT recently it's not the food that has been off putting but the atmosphere. If you like eating your dinner in  what can only be described as a kindergarten then this is the place for you.  People and their kids. Kids RUNNING ( and I mean running) around, ( which is dangerous AND annoying) high pitched screaming and unsupervised children messing up the buffet. I have seen kids aged 5 or so unattented, sticking their grubby little fingers in the food and fingering up the ice cream machine all while standing in the way. Employees standing around doing NOTHING about it.  food good.......bratty ill mannered children and their classless parents...bad. I won't be back."

It's gorgeous inside and you're gonna find at least a few things that are sooooo good. 

Husband is a food snob, chose it for his bday dinner. Was better 2nd time around, cuz the food of course but cuz ur more familiar with what all they've got. Our whole fam loves the little seafood things that come in the foil cup thing. Hubs loves whatever they have that's bbq'd. Tempura veg and the pancake things... very yum. My mom was disappointed in the sushi but I was lovin em 

Waitress showed up a lil late to refill drinks but it was hoppin in there and she was really nice

I have a 2 year old son, and they decided to sit us next to another table with a 2ish year old. Needless to say they started talking. Talking turned into baby yelling and well, they were acting like 2 year olds. The ""head server"" came to our table and the one next to us and basically told us to shut our children up. They're 2!!  Being that I'm a waitress, I thought this was really rude, so I walked to the host stand and asked to speak to a manager. I told the host what happened and she said they had a complaint. I told her my son is two, and she said ""well you should have taken him outside""

They had every kind of soup like 7 kinds, did't try the miso but really wanted to I just kept eating everything and got full. SO yea they have a huge selection and a salad bar and desert bar and even soft serve. At least 10 different kinds of cakes and more! Totally worth the $12 bucks! I'll go again and try that miso..."

I know not to expect the food to be amazing but most of everything is either over or undercooked, stale, or too salty but hey, at least they keep it hot and the variety of different foods is spectacular.

What I love about this place is that they have sushi here that doesn't suck, and it's way better than what you'd expect given the price. It's at least as good as the stuff you would buy from HEB, and that's like $9 for a SINGLE ROLL. ALL YOU CAN EAT BABY! So yeah, sushi is a big selling point here. But what's also awesome is that beyond the typical Chinese fare like General Tso's Chicken, lo mein, and what not that you usually see at a buffet, they have Korean BBQ and yellow curry chicken and more! Super excited to see all of this stuff. Attempt to exercise enough self control to fit some ice cream inside you after cause they have one of those soft serve machines too!

When it comes to sushi, I'm not the biggest fan, but I tried some of theirs and was impressed. Just remember to play it safe with sushi and if it doesn't look fresh, or the avocado looks oxidized, pass on it and/or wait for the sushi chefs to bring out the next fresh batch.

Service: friendly and prompt.  Possibly a little defensive.  (I'm sure buffet waitstaff don't get much in the way of tips.)

Facilities: The walls, from table level to top-of-my-head level, were lightly spattered all over with food material.  Even the pretty oriental flower prints tastefully hung at the level of diners' heads had noticeable spatters.  The window blinds were spattered.  I'm sorry, I really found this severely off-putting.  Any buffet place probably ought to make an extra effort to avoid the ""trough"" motif, whereas this dove right in, snout-first, if you will.

"E4hTk9Lp7ElcSiO5Tl_aFg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"SO. MUCH. FOOD. OM. NOM. NOM.

The Good
- Great variety - the buffet includes traditional american-chinese favorites, korean dishes, salads, sushi, soup, and dumplings. 
- Great prices - I think lunch runs around 8 dollars a person, pretty cheap for the food you get. 
- Great service - I've never had anything to complain about, the servers fill drinks and clear plates when needed. 
- Out of the buffet items I always go for the Baked Salmon, Bulgogi, Sesame Chicken, and Miso Soup. 
- Ambiance is stylish and clean. White people/suburbia -friendly. 

The Bad
- Sushi. I'm picky about my sushi, so I avoid buffet stuff. 
- if you go during the lunch rush (12 pm) the dining area can get a little loud and crowded. 

The Verdict
- Better asian fare is readily available in Austin. However, Buffet Palace provides solid fare at a great price. Go forth and nom."

Since it expanded to different ones this is the one we go to now and usually on special occasions because it's far away. But it's a great place for family gatherings, birthdays, graduation parties etc. It can seat a lot. We love the owners. Nicest people around. Food is consistent. My go-tos are always there. Chow mein, sesame chicken, fried rice, sushi, dumplings, kalbi, spicy chicken soup, fried chicken wings, Jap chae, fried donut with sift serve hehe all delicious especially during peak lunch and dinner times when they come out fresh. I love the new addition of the Korean sweet potato porridge. Man I can stuff my face with 3 large bowls of that. So sweet and good. Warms the soul. I would say this is our family's favorite Chinese buffet especially if you want a good variety and good tasting food. Each of us can get something they like here. It's a fun treat to drive down and come here when we can with a large crowd. Planning on eating more often because of graduations coming up :) Keep it up Buffet Palace and thank you for all the years of yummy service."

I normally make korean bbq at home and this was just as good. They had cooks making them every 10 minutes so the meat was nice and hot, and juicy.  ~$11 for all you can eat korean bbq short ribs is a steal!

We asked for a manager to inform about the BUG in my food, however, she had absolutely no sincerity in her response. She didn't apologize and simply offered a compensation.

Food was amazing, I was being myself, and asking staff about the dishes, they were pleasant and I had fun with them. I loaded my plate with a bit of everything - it was overloaded. That was my first time in Chinese restaurant, and I was not familiar with a lot of things, and I did not like some food, but that is just my personal taste, because my friends really enjoyed the food did not like.  I am not big fan of sushi, but I sure loved theirs. I was so full, and could not finish my plate, but the waitress was understanding and did not give me a hard time. I tried desert, hot peach cake and ice cream - amazing, I took it 2 times. I think I am the biggest fun of that place, we even took ice cream to go.

What I really like about this place is that it is located here in South Austin and it has a pretty good selection. There are a couple chinese buffets here in South... but this, in my opinion, holds up best overall.

The service is generally pretty good. They do seem to go through a lot of staff, so it can be spotty at times. Generally, I am treated well.

The food is generally good here as well. Go just before lunch rush or dinner rush for the best dining experiences. If you go late afternoon or late evening, the food tends to be a little iffy at times. Always look at the sushi before taking it. If it looks like its been there a while... likely it has, and you should pass. If you see them placing fresh out - grab it. While not top of the line sushi, when fresh its pretty good.

Nice soup selection, nice variety of salads, both rices and noodles, and pretty much all your standards in the way of fried and grilled chinese food. I'm not a fan of most of the desserts or fruits.

First of all, caveat that this is a BUFFET. It's not going to be fabulous gourmet food, okay? But sometimes I want a little of everything and don't want to wait. 

1. I was struck by how clean the place was, as many buffets are kinda grotty. 
2. I loved the Korean selections of food ! (not the best Korean food, no, but never 
seen Korean food at a Chinese buffet)
3. A lot of soups choices (at least 5, not just hot and sour and egg drop like at most places ) and the hot and sour was probably the second best I've had in Austin. 
4. The quality of the food is very good, esp for a buffet. Maybe not tons of choices like other places, but everything seemed very good. 
5. Good sushi quality. Agree that I would never touch sushi choices at these buffets, but it looks like there was a chef there so there was quick turnover so the sushi was fresh. 
6. Many dessert options. I did not eat dessert, but I'm sure your kids would love it. 
7. Oh and the next day I did not feel all gross and puffy which means they did not pump the food full of MSG.

"CmtAnunaNbVCTo5XGwOTyQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I used to frequent this place 15 years ago. I've since moved. However, recently, I came back into town and they've actually gotten better over the years! 15 years ago, this used to be a tiny restaurant with a much smaller buffet. Now, they're an enormous mega buffet with an endless variety of food! 

As a poor student with no money and no time, I used to eat here all the time. I'd eat one big meal a day and not cook. It's a GREAT deal. Here's what you get for $16 for the weekend dinner buffet; 

1. New Zealand Mussels cooked in a creamy seafood sauce. 
2. chilled shrimp, shrimp salad and seasoned hot shrimp
3. chilled octopus salad
4. Korean short ribs
5. chicken shish kababs
6. endless variety of sushi including salmon and salmon skin
7. chicken teriyaki
8. vietnamese spring rolls
9. crab
10. some sort of seafood concoction in a creamy sauce with scallops, shrimp, and mushrooms (yum!)
11. pineapples and other fruits and desserts
11. and much, much more! 

Be sure to go early so that everything is fresh and hot. If you go late, then some of the less popular dishes might be dry or cold, but that's true of ANY buffet, not just Buffet Palace. 

The waitress was very attentive, considering that this is a buffet. Most buffet waitresses forget about you after they seat you. Not these guys. Your dishes will be bussed and your drink will be refilled in a timely manner. Yay! 

Weekday lunch is $8.50, not including tax and tips, but my review is for the weekend dinner, which is $16."
"z_93zC2fuldY0sziSfrPBA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Best chinese buffet in Austin that I have been too. Many things to choose from: sushi,soups,seafood,veggies, and desserts. Of course the beloved favs will be there. My only complaint would be the use of dark meat chicken in the sesame chicken. Hot and sour soup was missing a flavor as well. I will be back if I am in the mood for buffet."
"qWh2Earwx9Y2X_GsQPmkVg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I've been to this place a number of times. Usually the food is a bit about average when it comes to Austin buffets. This time the meal was mainly inedible and I could only stay 10 minutes and couldn't complete the meal. One of the head servers came and spoke with me after 20 minutes of waiting and said she was going to charge the full price. She made no apologies about the lackluster meal or her unwillingness to reach a resolution. People, this place is not what it used to be as far as the food goes. I'm an ex-fan!

Update: I've seen returned and the food is up to its usual par. It's not the best buffet but it's still the best Asian buffet in austin."
"Bcy4_Bh9pQeHZLxp3bUf_g","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"Good for an over eating experience.

Pretty decent food, but hard to find the really spiced stuff.  Even the siribachi sauce seemed toned down with some ketchup.  I like the bulgoki beef with lotsa hotsa sauce.  Over some rice of course.  The many different sushi rolls were cool, I especially liked the one with raspberry sauce.   Egg drop soup was so-so, tasty but not much drop.   Egg rolls were decent, as we're the Vietnamese summer rolls and peanut sauce.   Some times you feel like a nut.  Most of the time for me.  I don't know what was in the egg pancake so I left it alone.  They had crispy won tons with crab in them.   Not bad.  Soy sauce on every table but they must be hiding the heat.  I'll hafta ask next time.   Definitely worth the price at lunch.  You get ice cream.   Yum!"

I don't eat meat or fish either so something from the vegetarian options made me ill. This place used to be much better, cleaner as well. No one who works there looks like they like life.

"tt-whKJ-vrC4DrpUuiUMkg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"I've written praise for this place in the past and am writing the opposite of that today. I can't believe the service we received at 3:45pm on the 7th of August. I've been going here for over 7 years and I have never had service this bad anywhere ever. I asked if I could just get soup and water. I know it's 96 degrees but I eat soup almost every day and at least twice a week from here for years. After getting sat and watching the host have meetings with the wait staff, of which I was about to find out why, I asked our server if we could get waters. We were denied. He said he was told to not get us waters because we were only having soup. I can only guess full wait staff service (getting waters) is for buffet purchases only. This is a not only a horrible practice to decline a patron water but generally a bad way to run a business as it follows ZERO logic and makes no sense. The place was looking up once they fired the last cashier that had really bad customer interactions but has since settled back into their routine of hiring people with no basic customer service etiquette. I have worked the majority of my life in customer service and y'all need consultation so here's some: the female host in white and older male server in black desperately need training in basic customer service/humanity. I know if my boss told me to not get water for my table that I'm waiting on I would insist my boss tip me then. Who denies their table water? Completely absurd."
"UhxXl8GqkbBEV2f_1Eaptg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"I think Buffet Palace is one of the better Chinese/Asian buffets of Austin. The food is laid out pretty well, you're not standing in line forever, waiting your turn. You can skip back and forth between different dishes and nobody looks at you weird.

They have a good variety of food. Your normal chow mein, fried rice, white rice... They also have sushi, which is pretty fresh and good. Normally buffet sushi is gross. They also have shrimp, which is normally really good, but the last time we were there, it wasn't so much.

They have a bunch of soups. I love their egg drop. There's also won ton, spicy seafood, spicy tofu and hot and sour. They also have miso, which I love. They have a million different salads, which are all pretty good.

The staff is really good about making sure that your cup is never empty. They're pretty friendly. Kind of shady on their napkins, but most buffets are. 

We tend to go here a lot. I like it."

I like their expansive salad and Korean cold dish selection. They also have Korean short ribs, an amazing seafood dynamite dish, spring rolls, crabs, delicious hot & sour soup and more. I think it's a bit expensive at $11/person for a buffet but go hungry and you won't regret it."
"-GiRdWtE7_AEp9iNkJusBg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"I like to visit here with my friends during the lunch buffet as we tend to stuff ourselves into a food coma. Typically planned a day in advance, I admit, I typically will skip breakfast or eat something very light and small. BUT ITS WORTH IT!

The sushi here is pretty good granted the lunch buffet is $9. Now if I were to go to a legit sushi buffet and pay $25-30  then I would expect a whole lot more, but WHY DO THAT?! You can get your sushi fix here for a third of the cost!

The first thing I notice about this place when sitting down, is that.. well.., you come in,  you sit down, and you spend 2 seconds to order your drink... Then you sit for two more seconds in awkward silence, you make eye contact with your friends... then the hunt begins!

I have a weak spot and always fall for the fried, battered, salty foods. There is nothing wrong with that, but if you want to get your money's worth and be healthy... well.. sorry friend, the word buffet shouldn't be in your diet. Of course you can finish off with some fresh fruits, but you came here to enjoy yourself so pig-out! Instead of the usual fruit, all you need is two things:

Fried Donuts and Ice Cream!

It has a little bit of everything and the food is actually quality.  I so love the shrimp & sushi.  The lunch sushi is not nearly as good as the dinner sushi.

"LFCS3j22N9olMMfCQFl0-Q","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"At first when my boyfriend suggested Buffet Palace for dinner, I thought he'd gone crazy for even suggesting a buffet that would most likely serve gross and greasy Americanized Chinese food. Surprisingly, and thankfully, I was mistaken.

While Buffet Palace does offer the usual Americanized-Chinese fare, they also have a nice variety of sushi, cold salads, seafood, and BBQ meats. A lot of items are either a hit or a miss; you're going to get some dishes that just aren't tasty. I saw a pho bar but didn't get the chance to try. The deserts and soups are only so-so. Several people have mentioned going during peak hours (around 7PM) to get the freshest food, but I'd recommend going a slightly later or earlier. The place can get ridiculously packed that it's impossible to move through the buffet line.

In terms of quality, variety, cleanliness, and price, Buffet Palace is probably one of the best places in Austin to gorge on buffet. The West Gate location is LOADS better than the location in Round Rock. Also, don't even bother going to the Buffet Palace on Anderson Ln. -- the building burned down a few years ago, but they still have the location listed on their website."

The food was not Buffet style cheap food. It was always fresh and hot. The kicker is we went in between lunch and dinner. They were not busy, yet they rotated the food and was was superb. Also our waiter was Martin. If you go ask for his section. My wife has allergies and he went to the cook to find out the ingredients for us. Our daughter needed warm water for her bottle Martin had no issues doing that too. He even asked what temp was right. We said make it warm and we can cool with ice if need be. He is the only waiter at a buffet that i have ever tipped 40%. Ever! He made sure we were happy at all times and even gave us some family history. I have no idea how the other wait staff is but i will ask for Martins shift for when we come back. And we Will be back.

They do a good job of making sure that the trays are always filled and the food is hot and fresh.  The interior is spacious and clean, and the service is great.

The chicken tenders with sweet and sour sauce, the teriyaki chicken... oh man!  I could eat like 5 plates of that stuff.

Had a long discussion with a friend about how they arranged the food... they put the cheap stuff near the plates, pro-tip just grab a plate and skip past the rice.  Ha.

I went to meet a friend, only the friend had to cancel on me... I'd already sat down so I figured I'd just eat there... alone... I figured it'd be horribly depressing, then I started looking around and saw a bunch of people were doing that.  The staff was still really friendly.  Asked me if I wanted a different table, made it fast to check out... refilled my glass after every sip I took it felt like.  In many ways they were more attentive to me as a single person in the restaurant than I think they are to groups.  Yeah... just it's interesting to go look around at who is eating at a buffet by themselves... people bring iPads and books... made for good people watching.

They get a special shout out for having actual beef korean BBQ ribs (kalbi).. half a plate of those alone are worth 18 dollars at some korean restaurants so I was very surprised to see them out there for all you can eat. They serve the beef ones on Friday, Saturday, and sunday nights. I absolutely love their korean raw crab and pumpkin porridge.. This place is clean and I can tell they try to keep things tidy around the buffet area. I don't know what it is but I can tell that the whole team from cooks to servers care about the place.

We haven't been there in a while, but tonight we definitely noticed new items on the buffet bar.  Steamed duck, egg tarts, spicy clams, pizza, chicken nuggets, and sushi hand rolls were some of the new dishes we saw.  Everything else was still there including the Korean side dishes, galbi (beef ribs), salmon, spicy crabs, and typical Chinese stir fries.  Luckily, all the old menu items tasted the same.  It's a bit far for us to drive down to this location, so we're hoping the original owners will consider opening a new location in north Austin."
"2P3GiGw6wJNKtBdIeVlJDw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"A monstrosity. That is what this place is. 

If you like soggy, overly sauced, monochromatic, unidentifiable american food that is wrapped in rice to make it look asian, then you will likely love this place. However, if you are like me, and prefer delicately seasoned, at least slightly authentic food that is identifiable, then never, ever go near this place. 

At least half of everything isn't labeled. Then, half of the labels don't have major ingredients listed. Its just a mix-matched mess of labels all giving different information, or none at all. I am a strict vegetarian, and therefore this was horrifying to me. To make matters worse, this is a place that drastically alters traditional asian dishes to make them more American-friendly, and often that means adding meat. 

Due to the fact that mostly everything at this place contains large amounts of meat, the few dishes that did contain vegetables had been sitting under the yellow light a little too long, and had absorbed their sauces thoroughly, making them soggy, salty, and way too strong. How hard would it be to keep the vegetables and dressings separate to avoid this problem? Apparently too hard. 

There was not a single vegetarian sushi roll. I've never even had that happen to me before. Usually places at least have an avocado roll or something, but this place had nothing. And the rolls they did have were soaked in various sauces, making the rice soggy. Many of the rolls were even falling apart, the rice no longer sticking.

I could go on. This was inexcusably bad. I love asian foods of all kinds and I actually felt insulted by this place. Even the banana pudding was messed up, it felt like there was sand in it. Don't go here."
"AJzxbF4YUUns21x4e5-TiA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Best Chinese buffet in Austin...kids friendly.  Great service.  Ofc, guilty pleasure when you do not have to worry about controlling how much you want to add on your plate! Sigh!"

what I got was an uncomfortably full feeling after two trips through the gauntlet.  and my second trip, saw more bare plate than food.  and this wasn't one of those bloated feelings that would soon fade (like a beer bloat).  I moaned and groaned for hours, ""ooohhhh, mhhhhhm, uhhhh"" and so on.  

I normally graze, eat several small meals a day.  I just don't like a buffet or all you can eat.  

nothing I had was BAD... but maybe not worth what it cost me; my $ and feeling like shit the rest of the night.

the place is good to look at, dick clark design and all.  I suppose that could be beneficial if you resign to spend all day there, making multiple buffet runs as stomach space became available.

I will say that the desserts tasted stale.  I just HAD to try one chocolate chip cooke.  I LOVE chocolate chip cookies.  how could they screw up a chocolate chip cookie?  they did.  it sucked.  

my wife was happy.  she got one of everything yet did not suffer the same misery as I.

We have many Asian family gathering here b/c everyone will find plenty of food they like and I don't have to clean the house and cook food.  LOL!"
"vSh7J2782vaNQ5dYTlWfZA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"We came here with our friends who liked and recommended this place as the best oriental buffet in town.
Indeed, the choice and the quality of food was rather good, and we enjoyed it. This is a good solid mid-level buffet. They have a combination of Chinese and Korean food, as well a variety of sushi rolls and even had tuna sashimi. While there is a variety of sushi rolls, the choice of fish is very limited (tuna, salmon, and maybe one more...), so, I would not consider this being a ""sushi buffet"", but that's fine.

The food is replenished reasonably quickly. The staff is quick with removing the used plates. A minor thing about service: for some reason, they take your glass away, together with your straw, - to refill the water (why not bring a pitcher to the table?), - I am always a bit concerned about what happens while my glass is away, and have they mixed glasses from different people on the table.

But the main negative factor that forces me to reduce the number of stars is the restrooms: both restrooms were in a bad condition, dirty, with paper towels overflowing the trash bins, dirt and water around the sinks. One person in our group pointed it out to one of the staff members at the beginning of the dinner, but nothing has changed by the time we were leaving, an hour later. It became even worse. I pointed this out to the cashier, while exiting, but she just shrugged her shoulders."
"0M5ELgdfaRMVbFUdsv5RfQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"Very clean, poor interaction at the reception.  We were there at 630 pm, but the food was either cold, over cooked, hard from the heat lamps, stale and dried out, mislabled, or greasy.  We were very disappointed and will not return."

The food usually is what one would expect from a buffet. The selection here one may argue is slightly more ""healthy"". As not everything is deep fried and heavily sauced. They also has some Korean dishes and pseudo Japanese picks. The sushi is very weak but for buffet you can't really complain. I would say overall Buffet Palace is slightly better than China Harbor (now, much worse than before), China Star(less selection), Thomas Super Buffet and others. 

So why the 2 stars? That would be due to the ""incident"". Some time late in 2008, we somehow had a large group of people consisting mainly of family and relatives going to this place. Toward the end of the meal I felt a sharp pain in my stomach and had to rush to the Men's room. No graphic details are necessary but needless to say it was not a good time. I would compare it to the movie 127hours except it was more like 127min. During this time I was joined by 2 other unfortunate souls who apparently had whatever i had. It was an uncomfortably embarrassing yet bonding experience. The only moments of levity was provided by several other guest trying to use the facilities which were already taken. They also have been hit with the same bug. One of them cried in a desperate voice: "" come onnnn, I really got to gooo"" while clawing at the locked door of my stall. He even grabbed the top of the door and leaped in a pathetic attempt to climb over. I unfortunately was not in a situation to dispense help though I greatly desired to do so. For I more than anyone at that moment felt his pain and deeply sympathized with him. Yet my mumbled response did not sooth his suffering and he then fled out of the restroom to god knows where in a blink of the eye. All is suddenly back to the uncomfortable silence shared between me and the dude next stall. Most of my family has left and only my wife remained when i came out and I suddenly has a new profound appreciation of life.

Most of the fare is the typical overcooked, oversauced buffet food you'd expect from a place like this.  Stick with the Chinese-ish items and you'll likely get through it ok.  Honestly, though, almost any strip mall mom-and-pop Chinese place is going to be much, much better than this."
"6dCODoTu0zgo_lc71Dmdaw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"A few years ago, I actually liked this place. But as time has passed the quality of the food has gone down. 

Pros:
They have sushi
They have healthier options compared to other buffets- fruit, a few of the sushi options, seaweed salad, white rice (at least it isn't fried), salad and spring rolls
They have build your own miso soup section
They have a couple of tofu options
They have veggie egg rolls
The krab salad is very light on the mayo.
The staff seems pleasant and attentive. Plates were quickly removed from the table as they were finished.

Cons:
The sushi is heavy on the rice and light on the protein.
Avoid the broiled stuffed mushrooms. They are dry and tasteless.
Very Very high in sodium. (I drank 3 glasses of water there then went home and drank a gallon of water the rest of the night)
Several items look much better than they taste."

ENTERTAINMENT: Cool fish tank, lacks in decor, gets noisy from people talking in this huge room where the food and tables are. The chefs prepare the food by the buffet so you can get some food fresh from the grill. TVs none. 

DRINKS: don't do it.

SERVICE: This place is great for big party's as they have two big rooms hidden in the back plus they treat you extra nice. Usually though they sort of rush you if it's busy and sometimes forget about your drinks but hay I guess standards are lowered for buffets.

That said....

What they have here is pretty good. All the Chinese buffet staples are here. Not to greasy (but still greasy, haha). This stuff is alright and I wouldn't really come back for it though. It's standard.

What's good is the Korean stuff. It's surprisingly good. All the kimchi's, salads and seafood salads were pretty nice. The short ribs and pancakes were pretty good too.

The deserts had more variety than normal too, which I like. They had soup and a noodle station as well.

I will say the sushi sucked though.  :(

Servers were quick and nice. Place is pretty clean as well.

I wouldn't mind paying more for better quality."
"cpS7P9V2jltelxUo_47WMw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"Everything you'd expect from a buffet, maybe a little more.

As of late they have a cat face spray painted on the side of the building. Me and my friend had a good laugh about that. 

The tables were clean, the server (Paul) was one of the best I've had at any buffet. He did everything but bring us our food. We always had soda in our glasses and the plates never piled up.
The food was okay. I don't expect much at a buffet place. The egg rolls were terrible today, but the sushi seemed fresh and plentiful. They had mushrooms, sauteed in some kind of sauce, which were really good.

The pros: They always have a ton of food to choose from, especially when it comes to desert and sushi. For everything they offer it's not too terribly expensive.

The cons: The food is always inconsistent in quality and things are frequently mislabeled.  I always try to go right before the lunch and dinner rush, right when they're getting everything ready. Even then the food is often questionable. Their sushi is always good, but there have been a few times when it was warm, which is a little unsettling to me."

I was honestly, pleasantly surprised. The Saturday buffet is $13.50 which is a little pricey but its the only good Chinese buffet I've had in Austin.

Highlights include the orange shrimp (best Chinese buffet dish ever), sesame chicken (crisp and fresh like an entree rather than a buffet dish!), tiramisu, and peach cobbler (not the best I've had but seriously, this is a Chinese buffet).

I could only eat about half of what I usually ate there.  The food was just either missing something or had too much of something.  The once Sweet shrimp was now some kind of Sweet and Spicy rendition.

Honestly the BBQ meats are the main reason I come to this buffet. I also like the selection of Korean foods and salads. There are also little surprises like Chinese duck (over by the salads) and homemade carrot cake. Service is usually pretty good, used plates are quickly removed and drinks refilled. 

Cons: I agree with other posters that the dessert selection is meh. Drinks are also expensive, around $3 from what I remember, and I would skip them. There is not much of a selection of American food, which is just fine with me. 

Also (for those using Groupons)- I used a Groupon and did not have an issue with tips being added to the bill (as a previous poster mentioned). I presented the Groupon when I was seated and it was handled smoothly from there."

The fried donuts and ice cream are pretty great way to finish off the night.

The day we went was the birthdays of three of the guys and they even brought out a small band for happy birthday and decorated some plates with a slice of cake.

You can't fault the presentation or the quantity, but I wasn't sold on the freshness or the flavors. You know how you can tell an adult buffet from a kids buffet by the taste alone? Yeah... it's like that. The salty stuff is salty, and the sweet stuff is sweet, but there's not a lot of nuance or love to it.

I also was disappointed by the sushi bar, which was heavy on overly experimental sauce-drenched ""custom"" sushi and light on quality fish and clean, fresh flavor. Try Thomas Super Buffet on N. Lamar instead... they're not perfect, but they do a better job."

I can't sit to come back and eat some more. Also maybe they can boil some crab legs without any sauce. Some people like me, just wanna eat their seafood with lemon and salt. That is how I mine.

"BD4M-iPnCLmtRqwyzy7b3A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Highlights: sushi, most meats, salads
Lowlights: desserts, seafood, rice/noodles

TL;DR - For an under $15 buffet, this is about the best you can get. The quality of the food is superb for its price and the variety of selections was impressive. Service was 9/10. Few things to watch out for, but you can't go wrong with most of the dishes. Having grown up on solely authentic Korean food, I can definitely say you're not going to find an all-you-can-eat for this price, quality, and authenticity in Austin!

Round 1: Salads
I was quite surprised by the quality of salads at the buffet. Most of the ones I've been to offer build your owns, but the salads here are not only pre-made but delicious! I tried both the Asian-style Caesar salad and the imitation crab meat salad. Both were delectable and I went back for more the second round.

Round 2: Meats
Generally speaking, the meats were what you would expect from a Chinese/Korean buffet. If you want some solid galbi, orange chicken, fried nuggets, etc. you'll get that here. The tteok-galbi was exceptional. Be wary of the bossam (). The meat itself as well as the ssamjang (dipping sauce) was not very good. 

Round 3: Rice/Noodles
The fried rice and stir-fried noodles were at best OK. I've definitely had better at buffets, but then again this is not what you want to be eating the most of at buffets so focus your time elsewhere.

Round 4: Sushi
This was probably one of the best parts of the buffet. For a buffet, they have quite an arrangement of sushi ranging from your classic California rolls to tiger rolls and spicy tuna rolls. If you look around the middle they have hand rolls, too! The spicy rolls were a little spicier than I expected but still very good. Flavor is great for all the rolls!

Round 5: Seafood
This was probably the pitfall of the buffet. The seafood was not good. The fish fillet was bland and whatever they put on top didn't help it any. The crab was not seasoned properly and had very little meat. This is usually where you get your ""money's worth"" at a buffet, but it'll be an uphill battle at this location.

Round 6: Desserts

The desserts here are also not very good. Virtually everything is too dry (cakes/bread). Go for the fruit because they were surprisingly sweet and ripe. The pineapple was the best for me (it also helps with digestion!)

Service - Was seated quickly and everything we requested was brought promptly. Only issue was when we paid and forgot about the coupon, they refused to redo the check. It was our fault for forgetting, but most restaurants will void the transaction and redo it to include the discount but we were told they couldn't do that. The waitress still seemed genuinely apologetic so all is forgiven. Can't beat the price anyway."
"rNeQksfiG4GEBLLZM-5KLQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"As a Chinese who had all kinds of buffet, I have to say the food here is pretty good, probably best Asian buffet in town.They have a couple of dishes surprisingly good for a buffet. My friend's parents gave them some really good comments. But the service is not a match for the food, the waiters are basically lazy, never refill the water we have, rarely come to collect the dirty plates,let alone organizing the table, made it like we were having a messy medieval feast. And they are always on our way to the narrow buffet tables. They charged us 10 percent extra, most likely for tip,even though it's merely like 12 dollars. This is not surprising, because I knew many Chinese restaurants do that, as a punishment for not enjoying poor service. The thing absurd is when they see us fight for the bill, they decided that we don't know we've been charged for tip, so they didn't print out the tip charge in credit card slip, expecting us the pay more tip. I did actually, leaving 20 on top of that, considering my friend won the tab picking up game, I were about to tip 40 to 50. Since the moment they see me put out the cash, they quickly come over to clean everything on the table even many of the group still out there looking for fruit or dessert. We have to pick up the fruit with hands.Grandparents and kids are happy, so I think it still worth 3 stars.

If you own a Chinese buffet, the lesson of the day is don't use unappetizing food photos on your website, because potential customers will drive way down south to Buffet Palace.

I almost knocked a star off because the sequence of dishes was rearranged in the chilled shrimp and salad section--everything was still there, just in a different order. Since I follow a carefully calculated logic at the buffet lines I frequent, you have no idea how annoying changes are. To be fair, my OCD complex is not the issue here, even though I'm right. 

There appeared to be less of the sushi-type things available, but that doesn't affect me at all.  Our waitperson was quick, attentive, and a round-eye:  I recall a critique that the waitstaff here are not of genuine Chinese ethnicity; seriously, WTF difference could that possibly make at a buffet? I left the dude five bucks. He was grateful.

"f2xATAugtN89mIoBrgqxnQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"After getting a Groupon deal ($11 for $20 Worth) for Buffet Palace, we decided to give it a shot even though we are not fans of Buffet-style eateries.  
Upon pulling into the parking lot, it immediately felt a bit ghetto and run-down with some sketchy characters hanging out in the back back part of the lot.
The fact that the outside of the Buffet Palace building looks ok, we hoped the interior was up to par with the exterior.  

As we got inside, I noticed there was a host who took us to our table
but the price board was small and far behind the booth which I thought was a bit sketchy but decided to press forward.  After being seated I noticed the tables, chairs, floors and walls were beat up and in poor condition.  Our wooden booth seats were sticky and just seemed over-used.  They could really use remodeling and a make-over.  At this point I was really worried that if the outside, inside and furniture was sub-par then the food might be just as disappointing.

However I must say, the food selection and quality was good.  Not to say it was fantastic, but it was definitely better than some of the other buffet-style places I've been to.  While nothing was great, nothing was terrible either.  It's not common to be able to eat Chinese, Japanese and Korean in once place and for one price.  The Fried Rice and Noodles from the Chinese section was surprisingly good.  The Sushi was a bit disappointing as the outside rice of the rolls were getting hard, which means it's wasn't fresh (dangerous for Sushi).   As for the Korean section, it was just ok but specifically disappointed in the Short ribs, Bulgogi and Kimchi as these are my favorite selections when we eat Korean BBQ.  
The desert selection was decent but not having ANYTHING chocolate ruined it for me.  I settled for some Jello and Ice Cream. 

Overall, while not impressed with the experience, I also wasn't angry.  I didn't expect anything great from a buffet, so that kind of saved the meal.  Considering not even saving money from the Groupon made this a better experience, paying over $30 in total for 3 of us doesn't seem like much of a ""deal"" (We didn't even order drinks!).  But the bottom line is ""While nothing was great, nothing was terrible either."""
"n3xxiNe7DTqIZbueAQBeTQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"The pearl of Austin!  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because the waitress should have warned me that I was going to feel nauseous from over-indulgence.  If they couldn't do that, then they should've installed wheels on the back legs of the chairs so that they could just tilt me back and roll me out of there.

Seriously, I was very impressed.  In my opinion you can judge a good Chinese buffet by the number of Asian customers.  If my rule of thumb holds any ground, this place should have been rewarded with six stars.  I actually started to get mad because I began to feel full before I could even sample all the types of food that tantalized my eyes.  

When I arrived I was sat next to a deaf couple.  Didn't really think much of it initially.  By my second plate however, out of the corner of my eye I thought they were having a Justin Beiber dance-off.  I don't know how to sign unfortunately, but whatever they were conversing about appeared to be really heated.  I'm talking fully extended arms and sweeping motions people.  On my third plate, when I was trying to figure out how in the world I would save room for banana pudding and jell-o it hit me, they are using sign language as a way to burn calories and eat more of this delicious food.  Effing genius!!!  

So yeah, whether you're into soups, sushi, noodles, salad, chicken, beef, lobster, tofu, or banana pudding, this place has it and so much more!  Excellent variety--too good actually!  If I ever meet the owner I am going to first shake his/her hand and then politely ask to change the name of the business to Gluttony, or at least Gluttony Buffet.  That way I'll at least feel warned, and then I will feel better about refining my rating to five stars.

In summary, best Chinese buffet in the world!  When I was done, I wanted to run up to the host and give her a hug.  Unfortunately, I felt like I was going to puke so I just said, ""thank you.""  Needing to burn calories ASAP, I got in my car, blasted the radio, and started doing some Beiber Language moves that I picked up from my table neighbors."

After going for years I can't believe the type of service. Too bad there's nothing less than one star."
"RTNqwH6mMhOOPJg_voZoNQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",3,"No matter how many Chinese buffet restaurant opens up around our area, we still find ourselves going back to Buffet palace once in a while. It is a solid 3 star restaurant. Love the salad choices, salmon, chicken wings, korean bulgogi, soup and sushi! It has everything you would ask from a Chinese Buffet. Their sushi is much better than other buffets around the area. Service is always good too!."
"PJL_kJr-ngRzg6MPY4lnew","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"How to start. First plate of food I got was so cold and bland that I was disgusted. I continue to eat as I was starving and just was willing to put up with anything. The second plate was so hot it literally burnt the roof of my mouth.  The chicken was stringy and way over cooked. The sauce it was drenched in was sticky and disgusting excuse for sesame sauce. The soups looked like trash so I didn't dare and the sushi was terrifying looking with how it was hosed with wasabi. The dumplings had a horrible aftertaste that is still with me as I write this.  The desserts were the worst part almost. From banana pudding that looked and tasted like it was already chewed up to cakes that were so dry you had to eat them with their ice cream. Then when we got the bill. Which took 10 minutes from when we were done. It was 36$ for two people. With automatic gratuity. I normally don't care about price of the food if it is good but this was absurd.  After getting the bill it took 8 minutes for them to pick up my card and actually get paid for the slop.

Update. Both my friend and I got sick."
"KNzraWwJWgmgX4XBhCdjGA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"My partner and I just ate here last night and were both pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was! 

I hadn't eaten at a buffet place since they shut down the one I frequented in my childhood (damn you tacodeli!) but my partner really wanted to try a buffet and we found that this one was popular with other yelpers. 

Driving up to the place, it was the fanciest looking buffet we'd ever seen! We're used to the strip mall type, but this place was huge! Plenty of seating, well lit, and very clean. The staff was attentive and friendly, and we constantly saw them bustling about cleaning and refilling drinks. 

Now the thing that really impressed me here was the variety of foods served. There's a whole sushi bar at the front which my partner quite enjoyed, many different types of soup, pickled vegetables, and quite a few Korean options as well. I'd never been to a buffet that had kimchi, bulgogi, and veggie pancakes! 

Here's what we liked the most:
Korean Vegetable Pancakes - these were the favorite of the night. The edges were crispy, the insides were chewy, and chock full of zucchini. Absolutely scrummy!
Pan-fried Dumplings - the filling was flavorful and the skins were cooked just right, not too tough. The sauce was empty when I went up there, but a bite of kimchi with it was just as good!
Chow Mein Fun - this looks pretty simple, but I love noodles so I gave it a shot. The rice noodles were so springy and chewy, and the shrimp were nice and plump. It has a mild flavor but isn't bland at all. A nice contrast to some of the saucier options available. 
Seafood Dynamite - My partner had two of these. It's seafood, veggies, and some kind of red sauce that's been torched in a little foil cup. This was juicy and very flavorful. A surprisingly tasty morsel.
Kimchi & Pickled Radish - great palette cleansers. Crunchy and fresh. A great compliment to greasy buffet food. 

Tasty, but not amazing:
Vegetable Eggrolls - I enjoyed one of these. The texture was great, but the filling was a little bland. Definitely needed a dipping sauce.
Pork Short Ribs - I loved the marinade on these, very flavorful, but the meat itself was a bit dry.
Korean Beef Cake - Wonderfully seasoned! A bulgogi-type marinade, but a little thicker. The texture was unexpected. It was like the meat had been ground up and then smooshed back together into these little squares. Not bad at all, but a little odd. 
Sesame Chicken & Orange Shrimp - Americanized Chinese food classics. Just what you expect they'd be like. But when you think Chinese buffet, these are what you think of. 
Chinese 'donuts' - these were a huge nostalgia bomb for me. I remember eating a lot of these as a kid whenever my mother and I would go to China Buffet up on Burnet road. Tasted exactly as I remembered. 

Pass:
Crab Legs - my partner was very excited about seeing crab legs offered, but opening them was a challenge, and once opened, there was very little meat inside. There are much better places to eat crab, so definitely skip these. 
Sesame Balls - I love these at Kula and Tapioca House, and I probably should've known better than to eat them here, but I like them so much that I had to try. After one bite I was done. The outside was at room temperature and a bit tough, and the amount of red bean paste inside was about the size of my thumbnail. 

The price is about $14 per person before tipping, and considering the options you have, I don't think it's a bad price at all. We left Buffet Palace very satisfied. If you're in Austin and want buffet food, definitely come here. We'll be back for sure!"
"5Lf6zQmOk07cIxVp0b-7Qg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",1,"Probably the only good item they have is the ice cream and cone. 

Everything else seems like its too sweet, too dry, low quality, or the item is just not there.

Mostly fillers. Wasnt satisfying.

It belongs in Los Angeles. 
Not a compliment."
"egIfsRcLnMXRB8GIG-addg","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Not the best Chinese buffet I've been to but definitely the best one in Austin. They have a Groupon special at the moment ($11 for $20 worth)."
"Y-H__dtR09XQdZTVwDM9_Q","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Love this place, probably the best buffet option in the area, very clean and the food is delicious."
"YmOKeiVWp0GMVKW7wZd_BQ","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Yes yes yes. This buffet is lovely. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The food is great. BY FAR THE BEST BUFFET IN AUSTIN- Both for cleanliness and deliciousness. I'm having a brain fog right now because I just ate so darn much,  but here are the highlights: Impressive sushi spread including all of the usual suspects, Korean short ribs, seafood dynamite, jop chae, Kim chi, crab rangoon. In addition,  there was a dessert bar fit to bring a smile to any kid (or kid at heart.)  I had the tiramisu and the lemon coconut cake. Both were fine.  My kids had no complaints about the carrot cake and mango cake. To feed a family of 4, you can't beat the price."
"_VqVH8QvCVfm22aGclYwoA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Came here on a Saturday night at 7pm since it was crowded at Kerby Lane.  This place is huge and we were seated pretty quickly.  The waitress got us our drinks and we hit the buffet line.

Sushi: Rolls, about average.  Not their speciality.

Korean Food:  Excellent, this place definitely has Korean chefs.  The Kalbi was very good and so was the seaweed salad.  This was real Kalbi and not fake kalbi like the last Korean place I ate at.  If you want some decent Korean food, come here.

Chinese Food: Good, nothing special though.

Other hot food:  They offered a huge selection, it tasted good.

Dessert: Cakes are alright.  They have a softserve ice cream machine so that earns bonus points.

Price: If I remember correctly it's $13.95 per person for the buffet.  An excellent price if you are a hungry hippo.

If you want a wide selection of Asian food or are just hungry and not willing to spend a lot, this is a great place to go to.  I'd definitely come here again as I enjoyed my experience."
"d662o7OPMikhzpb3fs_P_A","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"After trying out most of the Asian buffets in Austin, Buffet Palace has to be the best one in the city. It's definitely stands out from other generic Asian buffet places in that it's not just the usual fried rice and orange chicken in that there is more variety. 

They have a nice variety in their sushi bar. A little too much rice on them for my liking but it's nice having to choose other kinds of sushi rather than just California rolls. 

The Korean food there is what sold it for me. I was surprised the first time I went there they actually had Korean food. It's not anything special but when kimchi and the korean bbq meat is always solid. The food has always been consistent and has the typical ""Chinese"" food that never disappoints.

Service is mediocre. Went there for my birthday and surprisingly sang a song for me. If you go there on your birthday and prove it with your license you get a free buffet coupon you can use the next time you come! But it's only good if you use it within two months after your birthday. 

If I'm craving chinese buffets this is always my go-to place!"
"GetjbtzyFbAYdBvoHqpDVA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"Great food, really clean place and very friendly staff. I gotta say I don't like Chinese buffets but I really loved this one."
"R8GClpfGitEKjmmgCriRPA","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",2,"Was dragged here after church for an Easter brunch. My friend SZ recommended this place for our group of 30. We got there at 11 am and the place opened at 11:30 am. They let us wait inside though, which was nice, since it was drizzling outside.

After we got in they led us to the back of the restaurant to this room with sound proofing material presumably to limit our noise as much as possible.

I get in line to get food, pretty decent. Honestly, I'd rather go to Panda Express. My friend's stomach immediately hurt from the greasiness. The food was very mediocre and I am not planning on going back. To be fair, I don't like buffets so there might be slight bias in this review.

On a side note that is semi-relevant, I believe they have recently changed the pricing scheme as we each ended up paying $15.67 for LUNCH. This was including tax and gratuity. This was definitely not a $15.67 lunch. If you have trouble finding a restaurant that tastes better than this place for this price, please message me and I will be very happy to recommend any other place. 

Maybe I'm being dramatic, maybe. I really don't like buffets, especially at this high price. I could barely finish my food and I had other friends who agreed the food wasn't that great either.

However, if you're looking for a place to hold a large party, this is the place to go. The place is generally pretty clean and the service is pretty good. 

Another note, I did not try the sushi. My friend who did though pointed out that there was cream cheese in it if you're into that type of thing."
"XrBu1NSiu6chfooYuA6a1Q","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",5,"We are regular Buffet Palace customers and always enjoy the variety of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food. The service is always warm and friendly, and we enjoy the family-owned hospitality. The food is always fresh and tasty. I recommend anyone who wants a variety of flavors for the palette to stop in and enjoy this restaurant's varietal feast. 5 thumbs up!"

* * *

When the economy and the ecology crash,

And we are all living in misery,

Buffet Palace will represent the happy memories of our current age of plenty.

* * *

The place is enormous.

It has big plate glass windows, and is bright, sunny and cheerful.

It serves vast numbers of people vast amounts of food.

The food is good.

Nothing is unique or legendary, but nothing is mediocre or bad either.

You see things. You take things. They taste good.

You can repeat the process over and over again.

* * *

The selection is positively Brobdingnagian.

This means gigantic beyond belief.

Flashback.

When our son was still a little kid, Buffet Palace was by far his favorite restaurant.

For him, the dessert buffet was off limits.

Even allowing for that, he had sixty six zillion dishes he could pick from, with serving table after serving table after serving table of choices.
 
He had unlimited possibilities. 

This is something little kids rarely have.

Frankly, the situation is not that different when you are a grown-up.

Nothing makes me happier than unlimited possibilities.

Sadly, unlimited possibilities guarantee that I will put on fifteen pounds every time I visit Buffet Palace.

I pack my plate once; I pack it again; I pack the plate a third time. Note that this doesn't count the soup round that I started with before I even got my plate in the first place.

If I can still fit behind my steering wheel to drive home, I consider myself to have been very disciplined.

* * *

Breaking news:

I just got an email from Jaded Yelper, who has seen everything and done it all.

Jaded Yelper says: 

""That Buffet Palace has a lot of items on the tables is no big deal.

There are a zillion Chinese buffets out there, and they all have lots of choices.""

Yes, Jaded Yelper, what you say is true enough.

But Buffet Palace really does not have any bad stuff.

There is no cheap substandard chicken - which is the curse of econo Chinese buffets.

There is no cheap substandard seafood - which is another curse of econo Chinese buffets.

Because hundreds of people pile through the door, the food runs out and is replenished frequently.

That means everything you are looking at is fresh.

This is a big deal on sushi or a chilled crab salad.

And the execution on skill items is as good as it needs to be.

This avoids the third curse of econo Chinese buffets - which is absolutely awful fried food.

So this place has the price of a cheap buffet and the huge selection of a cheap buffet, 

But none of the downsides of a cheap buffet.

You can get your feed bucket and start loading up.

* * *

When we talk about sentimental memories of Buffet Palace after the fall of capitalism, 

One aspect that will stand up is that all of this good stuff was available to everybody, not just the rich.

Everyone from every social class and every ethnic group chows down at Buffet Palace.

You get both the families of doctors from West Lake Hills, and the families of road crew guys from the apartments south of Ben White.

You get blacks, whites, twelve kinds of Hispanics and thirty eight kinds of Asians.

Everyone is there with their wives, their husbands, their best friends, the parents and the kiddies.

Everyone is having a good time.

If you wanted to see that many people in Austin all being happy together, you would have to go to Memorial Stadium when the Longhorns are winning.

* * *

So this is why you are going to want to remember Buffet Palace later in history after everything starts falling apart.

There was cheap food, there was good food, there were happy times and everyone could be a part of it.

We take these things for granted now.

But these things are very, very precious."
"zLM_ICHke4nREPtzOW1FRw","HJisBzwgGpCZu0ZkO8LFzA",4,"Initially I wanted to give this place 5 stars however due to the horrible service I took away 1 star. I been here for about 45min. The food was delicious, I tried every dish. During that time my plates have not been cleaned and my drinks have not been refilled. I saw my server once and that's cuz I had to flag her down for some napkins which she never gave to me in the first place. When I asked she gave me literally THREE napkins. Mind you I am with my child and husband.

Aside from the shitty service the dishes here were more of quality over quantity. I've never been to a buffet where they actually gave veggies in their egg drop soup. They have unique dishes and their Korean BBQ is so tasty and very flavorful!! My favorite was the dynamite seafood which was like a little pot pie. It was hot and yummy. There was about 9+ diff types of sushi selection however the whole time I was there, it was empty and only 2 plates were stocked smh. But the best thing about this place is that it's sooo cheap!!"
